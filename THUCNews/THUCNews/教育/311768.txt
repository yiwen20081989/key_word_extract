　　Today, reaching the peak of popularity is the internet. As the exaggerative and impressive drawing describes, the internet are sweeping the world and increasing people are affected by internet. The internet nets everywhere in the world. Obviously, no corner of the world can resist the charms of internet.
　　Internet narrows the distance among people, or broadens it? This issue has become a hot-botton. No doubts, I embrace the opinion that internet narrows the distance among people. For one thing, by using internet, we can hear various voices from each corner of the world. Sitting in our own houses, through internet, we know that a black man named Obama becomes the president of America and he is under the pressure on interrogation policy. At Washingtonpost.com, we see that the financial crisis floods the WallStreet, and that the whole Africa is fighting against the AIDS. Without internet, perhaps, we know nothing about the world.
　　For another, internet gives us more chances to make foreign friends. If you are a boy, you may hunt a American girl friend by internet. If you are a businessman, by Alibaba.com or ebay.com, you can sell your products to Europea and Africa. Given all these facts, it is the internet that makes people closer, the world smaller and "One World, One dream" come true.
