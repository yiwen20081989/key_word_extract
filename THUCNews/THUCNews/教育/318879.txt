　　Children represent both the present and the future. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in transforming childcare into a formal subject of academic studies. Traditional childcare skills, which are passed on from one generation to another through oral and informal instruction, are not sufficient to guarantee quality care, so parents’ participation in care training is advisable。
　　Many parents might be accustomed to the idea that childcare is all about love, but this notion is misleading. While it is easy to admit that parents are responsible to attend to children’s needs, it is also important to note that children are too often insatiable. Unlike adults, they have no idea of what their behaviours lead to. For example, children are candy lovers without knowledge that candy can cause obesity and tooth damage. Parents should not respond to children’s needs for candy permanently. Parents who give whatever children want, known as indulgent parents, can be blamed for their children’s behaviour problems and unhealthy habits. Childcare training teaches parents how to take a holistic approach to care for their children and prevents them from answering children’s inappropriate needs。
　　Another misconceived idea of childcare is that it is a simple process of feeding children and making them sleep regularly. Contemporary childcare is not limited to this. Equally important for this science are emotional and mental wellbeing. For example, some children’s first step comes earlier than other children’s not necessarily because these children have intake of more nutrition but simply because they are more intelligent and curious about the physical environment. Childcare is a complex science that goes beyond nutrition. Whether parents have helped children improve motor skills and cognitive skills accounts for children’s overall wellbeing。
　　The points put forward above, I believe, offer some insights into childcare. Successful childcare does not lie only in love but also in skills. Children’s healthy development is measured not only by physical wellbeing but also by growth in other dimensions. With these borne in mind, parents might now be compelled to join childcare training.
