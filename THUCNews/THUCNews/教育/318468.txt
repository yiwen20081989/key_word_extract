环球时代内部讲义：英语专八改错练习
When you start talking about good and bad manners you immediately start meeting difficulties. Many people just cannot agree what they mean. We asked a lady, who replied that she thought you could tell a well-mannered person on the way they occupied the space around them—for example, when such a person walks down a street he or she is constantly unaware of others. Such people never bump into other people. However, a second person thought that this was more a question of civilized behavior as good manners. Instead, this other person told us a story, it he said was quite well-known, about an American who had been invited to an Arab meal at one of the countries of the Middle East.The American hasn't been told very much about the kind of food he might expect. If he had known about American food, he might have behaved better. Immediately before him was a very flat piece of bread that looked, to him, very much as a napkin (餐巾) . Picking it up, he put it into his collar, so that it falls across his shirt. His Arab host, who had been watching, said of nothing, but immediately copied the action of his guest.And that, said this second person, was a fine example of good manners.
