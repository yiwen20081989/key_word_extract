　　Dear my friend,
　　I’m writing to you to recommend one of my favorite movies 'Avatar'。
　　The movie is directed by James Cameron, who is famous with product Titanic. The story is about immigration to planet Pandora, and what happened with local NA'VI. The film is such a wonder that I thought it is well worth watching in one's whole life. 'Avatar' is not just a film about the love story between a 'human' and a NA'VI princess, but also a educational file. From the movie we learned that we must live in harmony with the nature.      Therefore I do not hesitate to recommend this movie to you. I am sure you will enjoy the movie。
　　Yours sincerely,
　　Li Ming
