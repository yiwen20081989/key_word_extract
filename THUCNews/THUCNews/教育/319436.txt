复习宝典：提高新托福口语的八大策略
　　提示1
　　Practice wherever you can and whenever you can. Any practice is good, whether you speak to someone who is a native English speaker or not。
　　随时随地练习口语。
　　提示2
　　It's important to build your confidence. If possible, use simple English sentence structure that you know is correct, so that you can concentrate on getting your message across。
　　以表达清晰为主，句型多样化为次。
　　提示3
　　Try to experiment with the English you know. Use words and phrases you know in new situations. Native English speakers are more likely to correct you if you use the wrong word than if you use the wrong grammar. Experimenting with vocabulary is a really good way of getting feedback。
　　大胆运用所掌握的词汇，不要过分拘泥于语法。
　　提示4
　　Try to respond to what people say to you. You can often get clues to what people think by looking at their body language. Respond to them in a natural way。
　　透过身体语言理解对方意思并作出回应。
　　提示5
　　Try not to translate from or into your own language. This takes too much time and will make you more hesitant。
　　尽量避免翻译。
　　提示6
　　If you forget a word, do what native English speakers do all the time, and say things that "fill" the conversation. This is better than being completely silent. Try using um or er, if you forget the word。
　　遇到不知该如何表达的时候，用一些常用词表示自己正在思考。
　　提示7
　　Don't speak too fast. It's important to use a natural rhythm when speaking English. But if you speak too fast, it will be difficult for people to understand you。
　　语速不要过快。
　　提示8
　　Try to relax when you speak. When you speak English at a normal speed, you will discover that most of the pronunciation skills, such as linking between words, will happen automatically。
　　说话时尽量放松，让发音流利顺畅。
　　最后温情提示：
　　Don't be shy to speak! The more you practise, the more confident you'll become。
