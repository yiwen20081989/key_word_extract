　　( )表示可有可无的话，字不够就加上。[a/b/c]表示方括号内由/分开的几句话选一句。

　　(2)给出两个对立事物或一个事物对立的两个方面，要求考生说明二者为什么不同或比较它们的优缺点，并给出理由。 具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: Some people believe that A while others consider B more appropriate. Give advantages and disadvantages of the two positions and explain which position you support.
　　对立观点式的三种模板： 
　　1.人们往往看到B的明显优点而忽视了它的缺点，同时A的内在优势没有被重视。
　　第一段：To choose A or to choose B is something of a dilemma to the public ause they sometimes are confused by the seemingly good qualities of B while neglect the genuinely good aspects of A.
　　第二段：[For B, people are often driven to believe that / It is quite easy for common people to CHOOSE B because of the obvious reason that] ____________. (As a proverb says, "Everything has two sides".) Although B does have its seemingly profound advantages, in the meantime [there lie [harmful characteristics/ intrinsic drawbacks] in it such as ____________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________] . Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________. However, it is often overlooked [by the public/most people]. (Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that B is always better than A.)
　　第三段： Unfortunately, the innate quality of A is often underestimated.
　　或：What is more, if you notice the invisible benefits of CHOOSING A, you can understand A more deeply. Here I would explain a few of the most important reasons for choosing A. 第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。(列举原因的句式见最后的"通用句型")
　　第四段：Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that CHOOSING AAA is a rather wise decision.
　　2.选A还是选B的确是一个热门话题，我们来研究一下，A比B至少有三大优势：1，2，3。
　　第一段：There is no denying the fact that ____________(whether it is better to choose A or B) is a popular topic which is much talked about [not only by ____________, but also by ____________/by people across the world/ in a modern society].
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(whether it is better to choose A or B) is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time (because it affects everybody in his or her daily lives).
　　或：In a modern society, people are always faced with the dilemma of whether to choose A or B. This problem is a much-debated one in that it affects everybody in his or her daily lives.
　　或：(如果是针对某一事件的题目，不是什么popular topic)If ____________(it is announced that a new movie theater may be built ____________), I will not be surprised to see ____________ (whether it is better to choose A or B) become a popular topic which is much talked about not only by ____________, but also by ____________. Although it seems that [sometimes we can not tell which one outweigh the other between A and B / they normally coexist peacefully], they deserve some close examination. [If three criteria were taken into account in comparing these two, I would prefer A. / As far as I am concerned, I vote for the latter]. There are no less than three advantages in A as rendered below:
　　第二段 第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。 
　　第三段 In conclusion, (it must be explained that these three reasons sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive than any one of them.) Only these three reasons are enough to make a person draw the conclusion that ____________ , not to mention there are more.
　　3.选A还是选B的确是一个热门话题，我们来研究一下，二者各有优势，不过我来选的话，A的优点还是比B多。
　　第一段前两句同2，第三句
　　While both the two [methods/choices] may have their advantages and disadvantages, they can be applied under different circumstances. Later on, I will explain my opinion about it.
　　第二段：[A has the obvious advantage that / One very strong argument for A is that] ____________. But there lies intrinsic harmful characteristic in this method. Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________ Furthermore, ____________. Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that A is always better than B.
　　第三段：On the other hand, choosing B also has advantages to some extent, For example, ____________. However, once again, it is important to see that under certain circumstances B will____________(disadvantage)
　　或：Yet there are some people who cast serious doubts on B
　　或：Although B does have its seemingly profound [advantages/ reason],in the meantime[there lie intrinsic [harmful characteristics/drawbacks] in it such as ________________________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________].
　　第四段：(针对我个人的情况又可以说出一套理由)But if all these factors are contemplated, [as far as I am concerned / according to my knowledge], the advantages of A carry more weight than those of B because A fits [me/us students] better in two ways: In the first place, ____________, In the second place/secondly,____________Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that choosing A is a rather wise decision.
　　或：(我个人的情况说不出什么新的理由，只好说我觉得A优点就是比B多)
　　It seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because all of them have their advantages and disadvantages to the extent that it is hard to distinguish. Yet that does not mean that they are all the same to me. Which one I prefer depends on my own experience, life style and [emotional concerns / educational background/____________]. [As far as I am concerned / According to my personality and fondness/ To be frank], I would like to choose A, because there are too many benefits that outnumber its disadvantages not to choose it. B, on the other hand, has advantages no more than its disadvantages.
