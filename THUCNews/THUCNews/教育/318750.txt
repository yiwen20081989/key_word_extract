　　全国的口语考题在一次考试中是相同的。但是有可能分布在周六，周日，周一，周二的考题是不同的。但是范围基本就是预测的内容(除非遇到换题)。预测中的考题是分散在每位考生的身上，所以范围无法缩小，每位考生在第一部分会遇到名字，家乡，学习、工作，然后还会遇到1到2方面内容，例如，生日和自行车，或家和互联网，这个具体是考官决定的。所以建议大家都准备好思路，一定想出汉语答案。
　　如果同学们遇到了新内容，请一定写出来，这样我们就知道会有什么变化了。
　　请同学们考试时千万要注意时态，用词。例如：问同学邮件的好处，不要上来就说it’s fast and convenient。这就是用词简单，分数最多6分。请在家组织好语言，这样更有自信。
　　注意：各位考生不要把流利作为口语的标准，考官更看重的是语调，语法和用词。雅思考试不是大词就能得高分，而是用词要准确。
