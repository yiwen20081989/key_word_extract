　　LC two
　　W: So, why exactly does your job have reputation for being stressful?
　　M: Stress is generally driven by the feeling of being out of control of a situation and the feeling of a situation controlling you. Trading in financial markets combines both。
　　W: How do you relax in the evening?
　　M: I very rarely do anything work-related so it’s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I had a bad day. I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away. To do something my brain will regard as creative。
　　W: Do you think what you do to relax is an effective way to beat stress?
　　M: I don’t think there is a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find out what I do is effective for me。
　　W: Would you consider changing your job because of the high stress factor?
　　M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing. And if used the right way can actually be a positive thing。
　　W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?
　　M: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short medium and long term trading performance and success。
