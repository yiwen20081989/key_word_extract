　　Chicken Soup for the Soul
　　Since I just finished my busiest three years in life, I didn’t have much time to do my reading. And finishing a long novel seemed almost impossible. I developed the habit of reading short stories that can both entertain me and give me strength. And Chicken Soup for the Soul was one of them.
　　When
　　I finished reading it approximately 2 years ago.
　　But I didn’t rush through it.
　　Instead, I read it religiously,
　　one or two for each day.
　　I didn’t want to waste good reading material, so I savored every one of them.
　　What
　　In it were many stories and anecdotes that can inspire and enlighten you.
　　Usually, every story has a positive message.
　　Frankly, I learned much in between the lines.
　　Why
　　The reason I like this book very much was on the one hand, it reminds me of many wonderful things in my childhood and on the other hand, it gives me reason, wisdom and maturity.
　　It coincided with the period in my life where I had many doubts, I was confused.
　　This book indirectly provided me many answers to such puzzles.
　　It taught me to think.
　　Thinking is such a noble habit.
　　Learning only provides us materials of knowledge;
　　it is thinking that makes what we learn ours.
