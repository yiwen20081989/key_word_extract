　　2.虚拟语气
　　承接刚刚讲过的内容：虚拟语气的本质就是“说废话”。这里，我们开始探讨“说废话”的几种情况：
　　第一，在表示虚拟的条件句中“对现在事实说废话”，此时，主句也要做相应的变化予以配合。
　　示例：If I had a lot of money, I would buy a new car.(实际情况呢，没钱！)
　　第二，在表示虚拟的条件句中“对过去事实说废话”，此时，主句也要做相应的变化予以配合。
　　示例：If you had told me the truth earlier, I would not have acted like that.(实际情况呢，你没告诉我，而我呢，也就那样做了！)
　　第三，在表示虚拟的条件句中“对将来事实说废话”，此时，主句也要做相应的变化予以配合。
　　示例：If I were to die tomorrow, I would not sleep tonight.(实际情况呢？身体棒着呢！明天不可能死，今晚呢，也就会照常呼呼大睡！)
