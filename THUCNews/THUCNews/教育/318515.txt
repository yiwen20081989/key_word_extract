　　Part IV：句子翻译
　　1. 煎鱼加炸薯片在英国历来是很受欢迎的一道菜，但由于海洋被过度捕捞的缘故，鱼变得是越来越贵了。所以，听到巨大的鱼把北海石油钻台的潜水员吓得不轻就着实让人吃惊了。
　　2. 石油钻台要经常修理，往往须在水下一百英尺黑暗中工作的潜水员们在工作时被撞到他们身上去的巨大的鱼吓得是魂不附体。现在他们有了特制的笼子来保护自己不受这些怪物的侵扰。
　　3. 这些鱼不是鲨鱼和食人鲸，而是如鳕鱼和鳐鱼这些人们最喜欢吃的鱼类，他们长到了非同寻常的尺寸，有时到了12英尺长。
　　4. 这些鱼长得如此之大有三个因素所致：围绕海下面很热的石油管道的温暖的水；石油钻台上面工作人员扔到海里去的充足的食物；石油钻台周围绝对没有渔船。结果，这些鱼在可爱的暖水里吃啊吃，长啊长。究竟是谁吃谁呢？
　　答案：
　　1. Fish and chips has always been a favorite dish in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive. So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying divers on North Sea oil rigs.
　　2. Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work. Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters.
　　3. The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but favorite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unusual sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length. 
　　4. Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who eats who?
