绝不能错过的2月28日雅思大作文预测 
　　1月份已经考过一次流程图，因此2月考的几率比较小。2月份考了一次表格图，这次仍然要注意，因为在去年表格图和柱状图是平分秋色的。混合图的出现可能还是较大的。
　　大作文部分
　　一月份出现了两次新题，所以这次考试也应该留意比较新颖的抽象话题的出现。
　　参考题目：
　　1 Some people think we should invent a new language that can be used by people all over the world for international communication. Do you think its benefits would outweigh the problems?
　　2 Some people think that personal happiness is directly related to economic success. Others argue that the happiness depends on completely other factors. Discuss both of the views and give your own opinion？
　　然后就是几乎一月一次的教育类，可以说是28号考试最有可能出现的，考生应该重点关注。其中科目问题，科技对于孩子们的影响，老师的作用都要提前复习下。
　　参考题目：
　　1 Nowadays, some universities offer graduate students skills that assist to find employment, but some people believe the main function of university should be to access knowledge for its sake? What’s your opinion?
　　2 Some people think universities should provide knowledge and skills related to future career, others think the true function of university is to give access to knowledge that students are interested in. What is your opinion of the main function of university?
　　3 Some people believe that it is better for the students to learn a foreign language at primary schools rather than in secondary schools. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
　　4 Intelligent students should be educated with other students. To what extent do you agree?
　　5 Some people believe that a country benefits greatly with a high percentage of young people who go to university, while others argue that it only leads to graduate unemployment. Discuss both views and give your opinion
　　最后还要留意一下弱势群体，比如老人。此外，动物类话题也是要注意的。
　　参考题目：
　　1 Elderly people should be encouraged to use modern technology. Do you agree or disagree?
　　2 Pets should not be allowed in big cities. Do you agree?
