　　本次四级考试总体难度正常。作文延续去年的特征，超越校园现象，考察社会热点问题，类似于传统的六级作文；其中提纲的第一部分要求考生写出博物馆开放的原因，考生较难把握。
　　快速阅读延续去年的发展趋势，逐渐靠近深度阅读，部分题项的答案需要仔细斟酌，但是答题方法不变，主要是通过题干的信息词对应到原文查找答案。
　　听力部分考察的校园学习和生活的内容较少，考察社会生活的内容居多。对话与短文难度适中，但是复合式听写的难度较大，原因是三个句子的听写每个句子都由两部分组成，考生难免顾此失彼，对于不擅长句子听写的同学，答题要点是应该重点听写第二部分的内容，第一部分通过关键词的提示来完成。例如第44句. Our second rule is this: it is better to study very briefly by often. 第一部分的关键词为second rule。第46句的spread out在文章的前面有，考生可以在借鉴。　　62.A person’s hair may reveal where they have lived。
　　63. Food and drink leave traces in one’s body tissues。
　　64. The water it delivers becomes lighter when it moves inland。
　　65. A map showing the regional differences of tap water。
　　66. It helps the police narrow down possibilities in detective work。

　　72. while
　　73. slipping
　　74. if
　　75. larger
　　76. liable to

　　78. over
　　79. decay
　　80. relieved
　　81. widening
　　82. massive
　　83. cycles
　　84. or
　　85. predicts
　　86. likely
　　翻译：
　　87. difficulty (in) keeping up with his classmates
　　88. wouldn’t have been caught by the rain
　　89. more likely to put on weight
　　90. What many people don’t realize
　　91. closely related to the lack of evercise
　　阅读和完型填空理解难度适中，文章内容属社会热点问题。
　　翻译主要考察语法和常用表达，符合四级翻译的传统特征。87、89、91考察常用词组：have difficulty in doing&keep up with；put on weight； the lack of; 88题考察虚拟语气；89题考察名词性从句
　　作文
　　Free Admission  to  museums
　　越来越多的博物馆免费对外开放的目的是什么？
　　也会带来一些问题；
　　你的看法？
　　Free Admission to Museums?
　　Nowadays, a lot of museums open to the public for free, and a lot of people are attracted to go there. However, it also brought some unexpected problems。
　　At present, people can get knowledge from many ways like libraries, internet, and other sources. However, there is also much information that people cannot get from the above ways. Free admission museums supply more chances for the public to get knowledge that cannot be easily accessed. People can learn more things about history, art, science and so on. Although, this kind of policy brought much convenience to the public, it also caused some problems. For example, beggars and shabby-dressed people may enter the museums and cause bad reputation among the public; along with the increasing number of people getting into museums, there will be no enough service establishments to meet the requirements; besides, under the policy of free admission, the cultural relics displayed there may be inevitably broken or damaged by the crowds. Moreover, the crowds in the museums may also cause security problems。
　　In my opinion, free admission is a good policy for the public, and it brings the public much convenience. But, we should also take possible measures to protect the cultural relics and maintain the order of spot. Besides, we can also take the policy of giving free admission first to children, then to the retired person, and last to the public. I think, this may help to solve the problems。
