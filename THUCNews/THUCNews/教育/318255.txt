雅思论说文经典范文：学好一门语言的方法
　　In order to learn a language well, we should also learn about the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it.
　　To what extent do you agree or disagree?
　　我完全赞成这个断言，即：要学好一门语言，我们还应该了解这门语言的国家、文化和人民的生活方式。
　　I fully support the assertion that to learn a language well, we should also learn about the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it.
　　先来看看我们一般情况下是如何定义“真正学好一门语言”的。按照我的理解，学好一门语言意味着能够妥当地使用它。这里，对于妥当使用它而言，我们需要知道：由于文化上的差异，很多东西会因此而非常不同。比如，中国人常通过问“吃了吗？”来表达问候，而这对于西方人来讲便构成了午饭或晚饭的邀请。因此，缺乏了对不同国家文化方面的知识，就会引起对所发送或接收到的信息的错误理解，结果便会导致误解。这样一来，我们就不能说我们讲得妥当，再进一步，我们就不能说我们讲得好。
　　Let’s first see how we normally define “learning a language really well”. By my understanding, learning a language well would mean being able to speak the language in a proper way. Here, with speaking it properly, we need to know that due to cultural differences, many things are just so different from culture to culture. For example, the Chinese often greet each other by asking ‘Have you taken your meal?’ which, to the Western ears, would make an invitation to lunch or dinner. Therefore, the lack of a knowledge of the cultures of different countries will give rise to wrong interpretations of the message issued or received and as a result, lead to misunderstandings. In this way, we can not say that we are speaking the language properly and further, we can not say that we speak it well.
