文都名师徐绽：08年考研英语小作文范文
　　小作文范文(文都教育英语名师徐绽)
　　Dear Bob
　　I have just come back and to my surprise, I have found a music CD borrowed from you in my luggage. I am writing the letter in purpose of apologizing for my inability to return it to you. 
　　There are, to my mind, several urgent measures might be taken to solve the problem. On one hand, I could deliver the CD with express mail and approximately, four days later, you would receive it. On the other hand, I would like to pay for it provided that you might agree with the idea. Once again, I am terribly sorry for any inconvenience caused. 
　　Hope you can accept my apologies and send me a reply at your earliest convenience. My appreciation to you for your prompt attention is beyond words.
