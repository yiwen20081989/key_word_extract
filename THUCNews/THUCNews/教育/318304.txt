　　Part II：语法学习
　　1.meanwhile的应用
　　meanwhile作为一个转承词，表示的意思是“与此同时”，在使用上与however有相似之处。如果引导一个句子，那它需要用逗号与句子其它部分分隔开来；在它的前面出现的往往是一个句号，或者分号，最起码是个逗号。
　　示例：I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole.
　　2.定语从句的继续
　　关系副词where引导定语从句
　　示例：My tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been.(where = in the hole，所以，我们也可以用in which来替换where，因为它们的含义是一致的)
