　　Part IV：句子翻译
　　1. 六个人被困在矿井里有17个小时了。如果不把他们尽快救上来，他们就会没命的。
　　2. 然而，事实证明，营救行动很困难。如果用炸药，震动将引发塌顶。救援工作者因此正在矿井的北面钻一个洞。他们打算用一个特殊的胶囊型容器把下面的人们吊上来。
　　3. 如果土壤下面没有一层很坚硬的岩石的话，他们几个小时就可以完成工作了。情况是，他们已经钻了16小时了，还有很长的一段路呢。与此同时，一个两小时前放到矿井下面去的麦克风使被困矿工可以与他们最亲近的亲属保持着联络。
　　4. 虽然他们已耗尽了食物和饮料，他们还是很振奋的，而且深信他们马上就会被营救出来。他们被告知营救行动进展顺利。如果他们知道钻透坚硬的岩石有多么困难，他们就会灰心的。

　　1. Six men have been trapped in a mine for 17 hours. If they are not brought to the surface soon, they may lose their lives.

Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives.
　　4. Though they are running out of food and drink, the men are cheerful and confident that they will get out soon. They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly. If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock, they would lose heart.
