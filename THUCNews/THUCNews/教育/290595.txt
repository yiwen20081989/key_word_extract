　　Why Do People Like to Buy Lotteries?
　　Nowadays, there exist all kinds of lotteries in our society, such as welfare lottery, sports lottery, computer lottery, and so forth. Anyone, whether men or women, the young or the old, may buy lottery tickets. But why do so many people like buying them?
　　The following reasons can account for the popularity of lotteries. First of all, most people are trying their luck on lottery tickets. They have a long-cherished dream of making big money overnight. In addition, there are some people who want to make donation to public welfare by buying lottery tickets. Besides, some people buy them just for fun。
　　As far as I am concerned, there are some risks in buying lotteries. People never should count on making big money by buying lotteries. Furthermore, lotteries to some extent are similar to gambling, so people should not spend too much money and energy on them. In a word, people should keep a clear head when buying lotteries。

　　Is Good Appearance More Important than Capability?
　　Old people often tell the young, “Don’t judge a person by his appearance”， meaning capability is more important than appearance. However, nowadays, with more interviewers putting emphasis on looks and the appearance of the applicants, a lot of people come to the conclusion that appearance is more important than capability。
　　As for me, I can’t agree with this argument. Good appearance is pleasant, but capability is more important, because it demonstrates one’s self-cultivation and practical values. It shows the efforts and the glory of acquiring something through one’s hard work whereas good looks bespeak no struggle of the individual. Besides, maybe sometimes a beautiful face can help a girl acquire a good position, but in the long run it is her talent not her look that really works in her career development。
　　Therefore, those without good appearance needn’t feel depressed because one’s success depends on his capability; those with good appearance have to work hard since good appearance cannot bring a person final success。

　　Cyber Crimes
　　With the popularization of Internet, cyber crimes have become a serious problem facing us. Nowadays cyber criminals seem to be everywhere on the Internet. To illustrate, some commit fraud or lift intellectual property, others snatch passwords or disrupt e-commerce, and still others unleash viruses to crash computers. As a result, these crimes destroy network security greatly and make computer users suffer great losses。
　　However, we shouldn’t tolerate these cyber criminals any more. It’s high time for us to take effective measures to fight against cyber crimes. First, we should reinforce the cyber laws to punish cyber criminals strictly. Moreover, we should develop high techniques as soon as possible to improve intrusion detection and prevent cyber crimes. Besides, more talented people should be trained and more effective firewalls should be built up so as to make the net immune to all kinds of viruses。
　　As college students, we have responsibility to join the battle against cyber crimes. For one thing, we should not use others’ computers unless we get permission. For another, we should be honest to others on the Internet and not release or spread unreal information. In a word, it takes our common efforts to defeat cyber crimes。
