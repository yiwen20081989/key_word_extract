　　There is no denying the fact that mental health is of great importance to college students. Nowadays, many students in college suffer from mental illness, which severely affects their life and study. Taking a look around, we can find examples too numerous to list. Reports are often heard that some students committed suicide or murdered their roommates. Typical examples include the case of Ma Jiajue and that of a girl stabbing her schoolmates. 
　　In view of the seriousness of the situation, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. On the one hand, due attention has to be paid by colleges to students’ mental health. First, lectures on psychological health should be frequently given to students to prevent problems from happening. Secondly, psychological clinics should be set up to provide troubled students with timely help.

Besides, in case of mental illness, we should not hesitate to go to psychological counselors for help. Only with these measures taken can we expect sound growth of college students.
