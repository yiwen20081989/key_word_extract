　　How to Succeed in a Job Interview? 
　　Nowadays, in an ever tighter job market, great importance has been attached to an interview. On the one hand, the interviewer learns about the work experiences, education and the personalities of the candidates, so as to pick out the right person for the company. On the other hand, the interviewee can get to know the job he is going to take up, the salary, the working conditions and so on.
　　But how can one succeed in it? First of all, the interviewee must pay attention to his or her appearance. The first impression is always where we start. The interviewee should get dressed properly and neatly. Secondly, good manners are equally important. Don’t be too proud, and neither too timid. Just be courteous. Thirdly, the interviewee must demonstrate his aptitude and skills for the job and his knowledge about the job-related areas. Last but not the least, to be confident is essential. The interviewee ought to be honest about his or her personal as well as academic background
　　To sum up, the job interview is indeed important, but there is no need to be nervous. As long as the interviewee has the ability for the job, with careful preparation and a fairly confident and honest performance, he or she will succeed.
