　　Create a Green Campus
　　It is of great importance to make and maintain a green campus in our university or college. Obviously, a growing number of people are beginning to realize that it is our duty to do that in the present days, since the concept of “a green world” has become the focus of the society。
　　The idea of “a green campus” is beyond a green environment. To begin with, the development on the campus is to be sustainable and recyclable. Some of the authorities’ budget should be on how to reduce of the waste. What’s more, we’d better be aware of the seriousness of pollution around us. Thus the idea of environmental protection may become a common occurrence in our daily life。
　　It is necessary that effective actions should be taken to protect our campus from waste and pollution, and hence these activities are to play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life. Certainly, there is little doubt that further consideration must be paid to our green campuses。
　　本次作文还是延续四级一贯成熟的风格，偏重校园生活。当然也结合了时下流行的话题，绿色环保。上面这篇文章尽管有些不妥当之处，但能较好的符合四级考试作文的核心：无论题目怎么变，都是以考察学生的语言为核心，不是考查思维和知识面的。所以只需关注语言的应用就行了。还是可以灵活套用固定的套路，中心句＋逻辑词的方式，做到不变应万变。相信大多新东方学员应该能够习惯的应用新路老方法走的思路。但是，还是这句话，无错表达才是四级语言表达合格的核心。
