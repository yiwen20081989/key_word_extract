最详细的考生经验谈：解析托福作文结构
　　131 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Only people who earn a lot of money are successful. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer。
　　Obviously, a millionaire may be one of the successful tycoons who have numerous money and assets. They may readily swim in the commercial and political ocean since they are rich and powerful. However, it is superficial to simply say that only people who earn much money are successful. One could become successful by doing a big job if he or she bites the bullet in work and can be with a little luck to get the opportunity to fulfill his or her dream or mission。
　　For sure, some people may argue that rich people are powerful, who are also successful. We have to admit that money is able to enrich people's physical lives and can be saved as incredible fortune to their descendants who may enjoy the brilliant lives for long time。
　　However, it is hard to believe that rich people are only the samples or role models of successful people. Some scientists as Newton and Edison have contributed numerously to the world of international development in science, physics, biology, mathematics and so on. Most are not rich but successful. For many, they spent most of their time in the labs to do the experiments which were the processes that have been transformed dramatically from theories to practices. These processes have unbelievably changed our lives and world. On the other hand, most scientists always keep in mind to apply the financial grant from the governments or individual donors. So, are they successful because they are rich? I do not think so。
　　Moreover, people who hold much money may become respectable but not successful by doing something meaningful. As all we know, money is not panacea, however, nowadays anything couldn't be done without money. Generally, anything will be done meaningfully with proper ways and a loving heart. For example, if people who are rich donate a bit of their savings to Hope School or financial institutions to help the poor children or disabled people, hence it may illuminate many children's or disabled people's lives and careers, and may totally change their lives. Probably, some of these children might become the great scientists or powerful tycoons in the future. Who knows? As a matter of fact, those who help the children or disabled people are lovely and respectable but not successful。
　　Therefore, it is pretty clear that I disagree with the statement that only people who earn a lot of money are successful. As far as I am concerned, the value of success will be represented by many significant factors. Money is a little piece of rag of them, which can not be either overemphasized or ignored。

　　People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, and increased knowledge).Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer。
　　With the development of society, many people are inclined to go to university instead of finding job after high school. Among various motives that drive people to attend college or university are career preparation, increased academic knowledge and new pre-social experiences。
　　Career preparation may be the most common reason people attend college or university. Nowadays the phenomenon of the high education requirements from many companies is progressively outstanding. As is known to all, people may get the better job after graduation. Despite the difficulties of the admission from colleges or universities, people still want to cross into the door to go to university. As the culture of China, some students, who are lack of good condition of study, attempt to go to university learning more knowledge and gaining more opportunities since they know this way may be the only and best path which not only leads toward their brilliant future also changes their lives entirely。
　　Academic knowledge can be much easier accumulated regularly by learning in university. Of course, people can learn knowledge through other ways such as to learn on their own, to read and even observe. However, through the traditional media of colleges or universities, they are the easiest and fastest ways to obtain academic knowledge. This means the teachers in universities, either our instructors or mentors, are able to convey the knowledge, mentally or physically, much more efficient through the adequate methods than other ways such as self-study. Thus, people in college or university can avoid the mistakes that happened before, which can save their much more time to learn something else。
　　New academic experiences help people not only to obtain knowledge but only to understand the social relationship before contacting society. University, in fact, is an academic society which is smaller than our regular society. However, the complication of relationships between students and teachers, among classmates, boys and girls is almost the same as that of relationships of our big whole society. Clique may occur in university like the community or group in common society. Teens that have interests in common like spending their time in the cliques, most of which are related to music, sports, books, or painting. They are very popular in every university. In fact, students who stay in the cliques are consciously or subconsciously tend to learn how to get along with others before attending the regular society。
　　From the reasons I mentioned above, it is pretty clear why people attend college or university that are career preparation, increased academic knowledge and new pre-social experiences.  As far as I am concerned, attending college or university is a prerequisite preparation before young are mature. People may accumulate essential skills in university to avoid some evitable troubles。
