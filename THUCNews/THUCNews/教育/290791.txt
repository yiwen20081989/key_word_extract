2010年6月英语四级写作范文及解析(昂立)
　　范文参考：
　　Due Attention Should Be Given to Spelling
　　1. 如今不少学生在英语学习中不重视拼写
　　2. 出现这种现象的原因
　　3. 我认为……(措施)
　　Nowadays fewer and fewer students pay attention to their word-spelling. According to a recent survey, there is a dramatic increase in the number of students who can only imitate the pronunciation of a word but be incapable of spelling it. In this essay I will discuss the factors of this phenomenon and offer my own view on it。
　　There are a number of factors can be accountable for this situation. One of the most common factors is that fewer and fewer students need to write English essays. Besides, the goal of most students to learn English is to speak it and pass the examination which means they just need to select the similar words according to the listening materials and passages. Perhaps the most contributing factor is the wide use of electronic devices such as e-dictionaries and computers and students no longer need to correct the words by themselves。
　　As far as I’m concerned, I firmly argue that we need to attach great importance to word-spelling. To the students, they should write English as much as they can. Meanwhile, to the teachers, the dictations should be reinforced in the class。
　　作文解析：
　　文章按照directions分为三段即可
　　作文标题中的due为形容词“应给予的”，考生在写作时切勿将其与due to介词词组搞混。
　　第一段开头喜欢使用句型more and more people attach great importance的同学需要注意这次的话题是“越来越多的学生‘不’重视”，所以应把more and more改为fewer and fewer。
　　此次作文整体话题及构架并不难，估计广大考生在这次的作文中不会有太大失分！对于1012的四级写作话题趋势，希望考生可以关注校园类高频词汇，文章模板还是以解释型议论文为主。
