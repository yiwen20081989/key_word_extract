　　As is shown in this picture, two friends are taking sightseeing by boat while a man is paddling for them. As these two tourists are happily eating some snacks, they discard the waste into the river casually. Not far away from them we can see the river is teamed with all kinds of garbage, including food basket, food packaging, bottles, lunch-box and watermelon peel. What a disgusting and depressing scene!
　　This picture gives emphasis on the need to improve the citizens’ manners in scenic spots. Over these years, Chinese people’s living standards have greatly improved, allowing a great number of people to take their own adventures outside. But just as apparent as people’s desire to go out for touring is their ignorance of their obligation to protect natural beauty. The garbage littered everywhere, the stains of spitting and chewing gums on the floor, the names carved on some statues and some other uncivil behavior, not only damage the natural surroundings, cause inconvenience and discomfort to other tourists, but also degrade China’s image as a nation.  
　　Therefore, to enhance the civil manners in attractions is in no sense an act of one’s own, it has far-reaching implications to our whole nation. In my opinion, to eliminate bad manners in places of interest, first laws and regulations must be set up and firmly implemented. In addition, a nation-wide campaign must be launched to enhance people’s awareness of the importance of protecting environment while taking a tour and to give them some tips on improving their behaviors, such as bringing a garbage bag along with them and spiting in the tissue paper, etc。
