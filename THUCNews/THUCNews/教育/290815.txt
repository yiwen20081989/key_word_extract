2010年6月CET-6B卷完整答案(新东方)
　　写作(北京新东方学校 王兆飞)
　　Almost no one in China can have failed to notice the fact that a number of students pay little attention to the study of Chinese nowadays. Taking a look around, one can find examples too many to list: some refuse to go to Chinese classes, some read few Chinese classics and some rarely write in Chinese。
　　A number of factors can account for such phenomenon, but the following might be the critical ones. For one thing, the craze for learning English affect, to some degree, students’ passion for the study of their native language. For another, the increasing emphasis on some so-called “practical subjects” closely related to the pursuit for jobs also cut into students’ time and energy spent on the study of Chinese。

First, students’ weakness in Chinese would lead to their ignorance of Chinese culture. Secondly, their problems with Chinese would also hinder the study of other subjects。
　　In view of the seriousness of the problem, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. In the first place, it is essential that the school attach more importance to the teaching of Chinese. In the second place, students should enhance their awareness of the importance of mastering their mother tongue. Only with these measures taken can we expect the all-sided development of students。
