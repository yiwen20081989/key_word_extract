2011年考研英语大作文真题范文
　　What a terrible and shocking scene it is! As is vividly depicted in the drawing above, sitting on the boat and enjoying their sightseeing, a couple of youngsters are throwing rubbish into the sea, with many dead fishes floating on the surface. What is conveyed in the picture is both realistic and thought-provoking。
　　The implied meaning of the given picture can be elaborated in terms of environmental protection and public manners. On the one hand, along with the development of the economy and society, people tend to attach great importance to personal and economic interests, ignoring ecological balance. As a consequence, environment has been polluted so seriously that environmental protection should be put on the agenda immediately. On the other hand, the inappropriate public manners such as littering and spitting are also one of the major factors causing environmental problems. If we let it go as it is, the nature will take revenge on human being sooner or later。
　　To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must promote and popularize the sense of environmental protection. For one thing, laws and regulations should be issued to change the practice of sacrificing long-term environmental health for short-term rapid economic development. For another, some educational campaign should be launched among the public, especially the young, to raise the awareness of public morality. Only in these ways can we achieve sustainable development and live in a harmonious society。
