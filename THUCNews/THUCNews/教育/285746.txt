教育展参展高校简介：德国弗赖贝格工业大学
　　2009年中国国际教育展将于10月17日在北京拉开帷幕，随后巡回武汉、上海、成都和广州5个城市，以下为德国此次参展院校德国弗赖贝格工业大学简介：
　　The Bergakademie Freiberg was founded in 1765 and is the world’s oldest school of mining and metallurgy. Several centuries of successful silver mining preceded its foundation。
　　Still today, teaching and research at our university are directed towards the need of industry. Practical experience was and is today a hallmark of education in Freiberg。
　　The mission of our Technical University has always been to research and produce raw materials and energy in consideration of ecological balance. The four core competencies include the environment, materials, geo sciences and energy。
　　TU Bergakademie Freiberg has about 5,000 students and offers all the advantages of a small university: short distances, no overcrowded lecture halls, an excellent ratio of students to professors, rapid access to literature, to laboratories and to training positions as well as a familiar atmosphere at the university and on campus。
　　TU Bergakademie Freiberg is very closely connected with the city of Freiberg and its 45,000 inhabitants. Founded more than 800 years ago, Freiberg still today strongly reflects this mediaeval charm。
