　　Green River Community College
　　Green River is a public, two year community college about 45 minutes south of Seattle in a quiet, safe residential area. We have 10,000 students, and 1,000 of the students come from more than 40 countries around the world. GRCC has a reputation for helping international students transfer to top universities all over the U.S., including University of California, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Purdue, Illinois, Texas, Stanford and Cornell. We offer a two year Associate's Degree program, where students can complete the first two years of general education classes at GRCC and then transfer to university for the last two years to earn the Bachelor's degree. We are known for our High School Completion Program, which is very popular with Chinese students. Students can earn their Washington State High School Diploma at GRCC and at the same time earn credit toward the two year college degree. Very economical. Green River has excellent support services exclusively for F-1 international students, including personal, individual advising, an Activities Coordinator and our own Housing Department which places students in homestays. Students can also live on campus in our residence hall。
