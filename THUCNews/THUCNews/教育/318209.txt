雅思76天倒计时基本功训练：完成时复合
　　Part I：单词与短语
　　It could be worse.(常用语句)事情还没糟糕透顶；enter vt.进入；manager n.经理；lose vt.丢失；upset adj.不安的，不开心的；sympathetic adj.表示同情的，同情的；complain about(动词短语)抱怨，申诉；wicked adj.邪恶的；interrupt vt.打断；knock n.敲门声；contain vt.内含，装着；outside adv.在外面；gentleman n.先生，绅士；honesty n.诚实
　　Part II：语法学习
　　1.过去时、过去完成时、直接引语、转折句式的复合运用
　　示例1：I entered the hotel manager’s office and sat down.
　　示例2：I had just lost ￡50 and I felt very upset.
　　示例3：‘I left the money in my room,’ I said, ‘and it’s not there now.’
　　示例4：The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing.
　　2.现在进行时的一种特殊用法
　　一般情况下，现在进行时就是表示眼下正在发生的事情，但是，有时候，这种意境会被有所夸大，从而赋予了它一种特殊的含义。
　　示例1：Everyone is losing money these days.(其实丢钱的人还是少数的，但对于说话者来说，可能听到丢钱的事情好几次了，所以，就夸大了一点，变成了人人、随时随刻都在丢钱了！)
　　示例2：She is always eating.(always一般是与一般现在时配合使用的，但这里很清楚，是与现在进行时配合；其实呢，这个she不可能是什么时候都在吃东西的，但说话者夸大之下我们也可以悟出一些道理来，那就是这个人吃东西的频率还是很高的！)
　　3.关于It could be worse.
　　这类说法非常有水平：在表示事情还没有糟糕到顶级的时候这么说，会让人立马感受到说话者的幽默和水准。译成中文可以这样讲：事情还没有坏到顶；还算好；还算幸运。。。
　　再如：It couldn’t be worse! 简直糟透了！
　　再如：It could be better. 还没好到顶。// 还可以更好些。
　　再如：It couldn’t be better! 简直好极了！
