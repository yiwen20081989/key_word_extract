　　六级作文： 1. 目前高校排名相当盛行
　　2. 对于这种做法，人们看法不一
　　3. 我认为……
　　It is a not-uncommon social phenomenon that the university rankings are especially prevalent in our country. For example, universities are measured by scale, academic achievements or the number of papers published in famous magazines。
　　As to this issue, opinions vary from person to person. Some people hold that university ranking dramatically promotes the development of university in various fields. But others maintain that university ranking also leads to some undesirable consequences such as academic fraud even to deceive people。
　　As far I am concerned, every coin has two sides. On one hand, University ranking does encourage the development and growth of colleges. Such growth? the grand libraries, splendid stadiums and fruitful academic achievements, has caught the attention of the world. We're impressed by these signs of our education's tour to the 21st century。
　　On the other hand, we have to pay attention to an unexpected phenomenon that some people have ignored the objectivity of university ranking. Take South university of science and technology of china for an example, this university occupies the second position in some university rankings. In those rankings, it is superior to Peking University and Tsinghua university. In a word, we should inspire the advantages of university and abandon its disadvantages。
