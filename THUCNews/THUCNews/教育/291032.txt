　　听力短对话11-14题解析
　　短对话当中，建议请求及推测内涵类是最经常考的题型，这四道题里面，11题，首考建议类，并且有很多课堂分享的关键词在里面，如BUT ,WONDER ,以及SHOULD 等等。只要抓住这几个词，此道题就把握得比较准了；而12题的特征是最明显的，第一句有序数词FIRST做定位，第二人直接引出‘but’，学生也比较能够把握。13与14题均属于听懂，推测内涵类，14题属于医疗场景类，look after  ,hospital , injured ,pass away 等等，大家只要掌握好这些基本的词汇。纵观这几道题目，从工作类到医疗场景类，四六级冲关学生需要好好把握这些基础的听力词汇。
