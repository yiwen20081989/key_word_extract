　　Campus is the place where university students spend most of their daily life through the four-year’s study. Hence, campus construction is of vital importance not only to the physical development of students but to their mental health as well。
　　Concerning campus construction, it doesn’t exclusively involve green environment preservation and protection, such as planting more trees and flowers, which makes campus an ecological and natural resort, but advocating green products. For example, students are encouraged to avoid using disposable plastic containers in campus dining hall and recycle wasted batteries and other electrical products properly. In addition to the environmentally friendly practice, we shall make every effort to improve the moral standard and ethical level of university students in order to create a civilized atmosphere for the sake of students’ mental health. For example, students will be severely punished in case of cheating in exams and plagiarizing in academic papers. As a university student, not only shall we increase our awareness of the importance of green environment in campus but also we take prompt action to purify the campus atmosphere and make it more harmonious。
