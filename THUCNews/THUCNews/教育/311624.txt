　　When the issue of poisonous milk powder gains an overwhelming focus from the public, what are these malefactors doing? As we can see from the depiction, enterprise, milk station, milk cow and even grass are trying to find someone scapegoating for this credit crisis, in my view point, that’s nothing to do with the credit but the problem of responsibility.
　　Responsibility is a keyword that we should never disregard,defined not only as the courage to face every foreseeable risk, but as the braveness to entail every malpractice when it really takes place as well. The causes of the shortage of responsibility or even conscience may be as follows. Firstly, inner cause ascribing probably to the destructive influence emanating from the decay of morality may result in the over-materialism .Furthermore, outerly ,deficient supervisal gives rise to the fearless adventurer who is at the risk of anything ,not to say to deviate from his own liability ,to pursue as many as profits. A case in point is the Melamine-laced Milk Incident which almost destroyed the whole of China’s milk industry.
　　It is imperative that drastic measures should be taken to end this thorny situation, such as enacting related law to reinforce our supervisal mechanism to avoid the behavior of kicking the ball when something bad happen and promoting social entities to regain one of Chinese traditional virtues, which is called “who would enter the hell if I wouldn’t”, that means, undoubtedly, to learn to be responsible for the blunder means sensible Unflinchingness.
