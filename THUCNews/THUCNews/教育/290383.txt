四六级写作高分指南：一句多译法
　　对于中国学生来说，英语四六级写作多种表达是一种综合运用英语的能力。从某一意义上说，多种表达也就是一句多译，其主要途径有：  
　　1、运用同义词语。如：“他上星期生病了”可译为： 
　　(1) He got ill last week.  
　　(2) He was ill last week.  
　　(3) He fell ill last week.  
　　(4) He became ill last week.  
　　(5) He was in bad health last week.  
　　2、运用同一词语的不同句式结构.如：“他写那篇文章花了三个星期”可译为： 
　　(1) It took him three weeks to write the article.  
　　(2) He took three weeks to write the article.  
　　(3) The article took him three weeks.  
　　(4) To write the article took him three weeks.  
　　(5) It took three weeks for him to write the article.  
　　(6) Writing the article took him three weeks.  
　　3、运用简单句与复合句的相互转换理论。如： 
　　The man standing there is a policeman.→ 
　　The man who is standing there is a policeman.  
　　What we should do next is unknown.→ 
　　What to do next is unknown.  
　　We are thinking of how we can finish the work in time.→ 
　　We are thinking of how to finish the work in time.  
　　4、综合运用同义词语与不同句式。如：“他做完练习后，便出去了”可译为： 
　　(1) After he had finished the exercises, he went out.  
　　(2) After he finished the exercises, he went out.  
　　(3) Having finished the exercises, he went out.  
　　(4) Finishing the exercises, he went out.  
　　(5) After finishing the exercises, he went out.  
　　(6) The exercises being finished, he went out.  
　　(7) The exercises finished, he went out.  
　　(8) The exercises having been done, he went out.  
　　另外，还可采用修辞等方法，以增进多种表达的本领。
