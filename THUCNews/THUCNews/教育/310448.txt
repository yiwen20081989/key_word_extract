　　Dear Bob,
　　I am a tenant from China who had been living in your house in Canada for two weeks. I am writing the letter to inform you that I wish to extend my sincere apology to you.
　　First and foremost, I take this opportunity show my heartfelt appreciation to the kind assistance you render me during my stay in Canada. In addition, I borrowed one CD of Beethoven’s symphonies from you in Canada. Unfortunately, when I returned home, I found to my surprise that CD in my personal baggage due to my carelessness.
　　To solve the problem, I would like to send this CD to you by Express Mail Service. Once again, please accept my sincere apology for any inconveniences I have caused. I hope the settlement of the matter will meet your wishes.
