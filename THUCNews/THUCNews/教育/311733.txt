　　As is symbolically illustrated in the portrayal, the Internet is a network of thousands of networks, linking schools, universities, businesses, government agencies, libraries and millions of individuals. The Internet exerts such a profound effect on our life that it revolutionizes the way of people’s living and thinking.
　　The exaggerative and impressive cartoon has subtly revealed the duality of the relationship between man and Internet. On the one hand, something like information superhighways, the internet can bring many conveniences into the school, home and office. With a basic computer and modem, any individual can call up information about almost anything from almost anywhere and anytime. But on the other hand, a great many people admit that they are too much addicted to Internet to maintain a regular and wholesome lifestyle. Such a waste of time inevitably leads to their failure in their life and work.
　　Hence, it is necessary for us to use Internet in a reasonable way and restrain from overindulgence. For one thing, in addition to providing us many of the facilities and services we now must travel to obtain, with the Internet, the computer will even let us communicate directly with other homes and with information sources worldwide. For another, as nearly all activities could be conducted in the comfort of our homes, we could all become hermit-like, never feeling any need to leave the computer. Accordingly, the challenge of the Internet means we should consider how we can use it, so that it won’t control us.
