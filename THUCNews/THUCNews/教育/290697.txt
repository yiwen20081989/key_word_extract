09年12月英语六级作文点评及高分范文(沪江)
　　本文是09年12月英语六级真题作文范文及点评，由新东方名师为大家详细剖析。文章题目《潜规则失效了？》
　　对立观点的文章一般一年不会超过一次。但继09年6月《关于名字---有人觉得重要有人觉得不重要》之后，这次又考对立观点。看来四、六级委员会对这种文字游戏式的新八股越发青睐了。
　　这种八股可以按照提纲写三段：支持的理由、反对的理由、我的观点。但最好在前面加上一个引言段。引言可以是简单的对全文观点的总结，也可以是相关争议的背景介绍。支持送孩子学艺术的理由不外乎成就艺术天才和培养兴趣爱好；反对的理由不外乎孩子压力过大和顺其自然等。到结尾段其实已经没什么好说：该说的在主体两段都说过了。所以只能总结加建议。
　　对于这样陈腐的模式作文，很多考生可以对之以模式。但如果不屑，具备实力的考生也还是可以写出点新意。
　　以下附范文：
　　Should parents send their kids to art classes?
　　A child’s world is supposed to be fresh and new and beautiful, full of wonder and excitement. Unfortunately, this is not the case for some kids, especially for those born and bred in cities --- their joys are dimmed and even lost because a majority of them are forced to attend various art classes。
　　Some claim that it is beneficial for children’s development. They might have their reasons because most parents are convinced that their kids are gifted gifts from the god. They presume that the earlier their children are exposed to arts, the more likely it is to find out the artistic potential hidden in them. Even if their children fail to become another child prodigy like Lang Lang or Li Yundi, the interests in arts, say, in music, cultivated in childhood will be of great value in their whole life。
　　In spite of the possible benefits mentioned, I, like others, am strongly against it. The major harm is that it might deprive children of their pleasure to play after school. Faced with competition and contest for better universities, most children are buried in piles of homework. Forcing them to art classes will leave them less time to enjoy the beauty of the nature or to find their talent in things they are really interested in。
　　To sum up, childhood is a time for children to play as they wish. Rather than cramming knowledge, it is more important to pave the way for their desire to know than to put them on a diet of facts they are not ready to assimilate。
