　　1. 试验证明儿童可以在很小的年龄接受训练学会游泳。在洛杉矶的一个特殊别的游泳池里，孩子们甚至在还没有学会走路前就成为了水下憋气高手。
　　2. 两个月大的婴儿并非显得不愿意入水。他们很快便会适应游泳，而且甚至可以从游泳池底部捡起重物。
　　3. 这些年幼的游泳健将们非常喜欢的一个游戏是水下三轮车赛。三轮车在水下七英尺深的池底排列开来。孩子们竞相抵达游泳池的另一面。很多孩子踏着三轮车，但大多数孩子宁愿推着或者拖着走。有些孩子甚至可以一次也不需要上来换气便走完全程。
　　4. 他们是否将成为奥林匹克冠军，时间将给出答案。同时，他们对于我们中间那些还没有游上五码便呼呼直喘的人来讲应该也算是一种鼓励吧。
