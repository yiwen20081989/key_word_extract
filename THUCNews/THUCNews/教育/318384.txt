　　Part II：语法学习
　　1. 虚拟语气的延续
　　我们讲过虚拟语气了，请大家再回顾一下虚拟语气的各种情况。在此呢，我们也将再次梳理一下。
　　如果大家没有忘记，那应该清楚地记得：虚拟语气就是说废话，是针对过去、现在和将来三种时间概念里发生的动作和行为说废话。
　　示例1：如果我要是再强壮些，我会痛扁你一顿的！(现在讲的话)
　　If I were stronger, I would beat you up!
　　示例2：当时如果我要是在场，我就不会让他欺负你的。(讲的是已经发生的事情)
　　If I had been there, I would not have let him bully you.
　　示例3：我多希望明天我在上海呀！(讲的是明天的事情)
　　How I wish I were in Shanghai tomorrow!
　　2. suggest引导宾语从句
　　suggest引导宾语从句时，从句中的谓语动词必须要用should或动词原形。
　　示例1：他到我这儿来时，我将建议他改变计划。When he comes here, I would suggest that he (should) change the plan.
　　示例2：他建议我把头发理短些。He suggested that I (should) have my hair cut short.
　　示例3：我建议将这个门拿掉。I suggest that the door (should) be removed.
