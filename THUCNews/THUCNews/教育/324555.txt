新初三暑假英语提高训练：阅读理解题(十一)
　　D
　　In the United States, parents usually encourage their children to develop their potential (潜能). They pay attention to what their kids can do, not what they can't. As a result, US boys and girls hope to be actors, athletes and doctors; many even want to become presidents when they grow up。
　　US parents often encourage their children to take part in all kinds of activities at school. They believe that joining in these activities can make their children mature(成熟). Schoolwork is important, but they think that social skills are important as well。
　　But things in China are different. Chinese parents often tell their children to study hard and pass exams. They think that, for a student, staying away from schoolbooks means wasting time.
