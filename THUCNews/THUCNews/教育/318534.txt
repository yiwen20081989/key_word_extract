09雅思口语作文：电影《穿Prada的恶魔》
　　I’m a big movie buff(电影迷).
　　I visit the movie theater regularly each month.
　　But over the past few years, the one movie that touched me deeply was a star-ensembled(明星云集) movie--Devil Wears Prada starring Anne Hathaway and Meril Streeps.
　　When
　　I saw this movie when I was coming out of high school.
　　Most people think when you go to college, you experiment with new possibilities,
　　you find a new style of fashion which is usually not allowed in high school.
　　I saw so many of my friends putting on make-up and pursued high fashion (haute couture) , Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada.
　　I almost lost myself in such a materialistic world.
　　And this movie was my life saver.
　　What
　　It was the story of a young girl trying to make a difference in the world.
　　She entered a fashion magazine headquarter and became a modern-day Cinderella under a devil-like boss, who was played by Meril Streeps.
　　The most impressive part was how she adapted to the new environment and emerged on top of everybody else.
　　Such a change is breathtakingly amazing.
　　Why
　　I know a lot of people say the movie is not the same as the book,
　　which tries to persuade people to stay simple and true to their own principles.
　　But I can’t help loving it because I’m also at the crossroad of my life now.
　　Am I going to follow suit blindly after other people, or do I stop and think and find out what I really want?
　　Being true is not always easy, and it has a price to pay.
　　But Andy, the heroine in that movie showed me courage to take any consequence of your brave choice.
　　Love it!
