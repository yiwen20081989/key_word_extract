　　Essay Writing(大作文)
　　1. Benefits of Joining Various Organizations
　　Last week, our class had a heated discussion about whether we college students should join various organizations on campus like Student Union. Some believe it beneficial whereas others think it does no good. For my part, there are many benefits for getting involved in these organizations。
　　First of all, we can improve our ability to communicate with people. Suppose we take part in an organization, we must manage programs. Then we inevitably need help from the fellow students and advice from teachers. And all these require us to have strong social ability. Secondly, we can spice our life in college by participating various activities. And such events as basket ball campaigns, volunteering works, and evening gala really can add to our emotional energy. Finally, getting ourselves involved provides us with incentives for our studies. When we join an organization, we often take charge of certain works like management. We are leaders. As leaders, we, of course, should set others good examples. And studying hard and well will probably be the wise way to accomplish that goal。
　　All in all, we can learn a lot from all these activities. By actively involving ourselves in them we can meet new people and make more friends, improve our ability, and above all study well。
　　2. Team Work How to Achieve Team Work
　　"Experience is the best teacher," people say. Indeed, the most important, and sometimes the hardest, lessons we learn in life come from our participation in situations. For my part, you can't learn everything from a book. And only practice makes you a successful person。
　　To begin with, first-hand experience is important for a child. When we were children, we learned the fundamental lessons of life solely from experience. That is to say, parents teach us by experience such as how to walk steadily, how to cope with the adults, and so on and so forth. Secondly, first-hand experience is also important for an adolescent. At school, we do not learn everything from books, in that few books can teach us successfully how to meet new people and make more friends. Finally, as we leave adolescence behind and enter adult life, no book can teach us how to fall in love and get married. But experiencing our own triumphs and disasters is really the only way to learn how to live a successful life。
　　To conclude, knowledge gained both from experience and from books have their respective roles to play in our life. However, in my view, I think the former one is more important than the latter one. The most important lessons can't be taught; they have to be experienced。
　　Note Writing (小作文)
　　1、A Complain
　　April 18, 2009
　　Dear Sir,
　　I am writing to you to file a formal complaint about a Sim card I bought from your company last week. The day I got it from … I found it not useable. So I went back to change it 3 days later since I was up to my neck in my studies. But the salesgirl said it was “overdue” and refused to help. I now request either a refund or a change of it. I am looking forward to your reply。
　　Yours,
　　Nancy
　　2. A Congratulation Letter

　　Dear John,
　　I am pleased that you have passed the entrance examination and been accepted by a very famous university. I feel proud of you and I believe you really deserve the honor since you have been working so hard. Of course, you will find college life both exciting and challenging. Once you get to know the difference between college and middle school life, you certainly won’t find the adaptation too difficult!
　　Truly Yours
