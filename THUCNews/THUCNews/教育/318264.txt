雅思62天倒计时基本功训练：过去完成时的深化
　　Part I：单词与短语
　　the Mediterranean Sea 地中海；in the Mediterranean在地中海地区；settle down (动词短语)安顿下来；even though (表让步关系)虽然，尽管；continually adv.断断续续地；bitterly cold 异常寒冷；sunshine n.阳光；get a shock (动词短语)感到震惊
　　Part II：语法学习
　　1.过去完成时的深化
　　有关于过去完成时，我们前面已经探讨过，这里除了进一步的深化外，还将引出两个特定的过去完成时句式。
　　示例1：My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England.(相对于returned to England，肯定是lived in the Mediterranean在前)
　　示例2：Before he came back, he had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. (发生在came back之前的动作行为)
　　示例3：Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.(表示的是在发生了后来的一连串的事情之前)
　　以下是两个非常有特色的过去完成时句型，比较多地强调或突出了两个动作之间时间间隔的短暂性。请特别注意它们的套用方式。
　　示例4：He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there.
　　示例5：He had hardly returned when he bought a house and went to live there.
　　示例6：He had no sooner had time to settle down than he sold the house and left the country.
　　示例7：He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country.
　　2.虚拟语气的初步接触
　　概念解释：在初步接触虚拟语气时，我们只需知道这一点：虚拟语气实际上是“说废话”！为了从形式上体现出来，虚拟语气之处，时态倒退一级，因此，如果原来应该用一般现在时，现在用一般过去时；如果原来用一般将来时，现在用过去将来时；如果原来应该用一般过去时，现在用过去完成时！
　　示例1：If I were a girl, I would marry you.(说话者是个男的！是不是废话？)
　　示例2：In front of them, I will act as if I did not know you.(不认识你是装出来的，实际上是认识的)
