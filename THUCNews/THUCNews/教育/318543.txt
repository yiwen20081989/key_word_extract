　　1. 日本每年过一次亡灵节。这个节日可是个欢快的日子，因为在这一天，据说死者会回到家里，受到生者的欢迎。
　　2. 因为料到他们经过长途跋涉后肯定饿了，所以为他们摆放好了饭菜。特制的灯笼悬挂在每家每户的外面为他们引路。
　　3. 人们通宵达旦地唱歌跳舞。一大早，为死者摆放出来的饭菜被抛进河里或海里，因为活着的人吃了被认为不吉利。
　　4. 在临海的城镇里，节日结束时头天晚上悬挂在大街上的小灯笼被放到水里。成千上万的灯笼在海里慢慢地越漂越远，引导着死者踏上到另外一个世界的回程之路。这是感人的一幕，因为成群结队的人们站在岸上目送着灯笼漂远，直到再也看不见了。
　　答案：
　　1. A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living.
　　2. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. 
　　3. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it.
　　4. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before are placed into the water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea, guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.
