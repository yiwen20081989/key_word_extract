　　Part II：语法学习
　　1.…, so…句型；…, but…句型
　　so引导从句，表示的是某种结果，当这种结果更为强烈时，则用therefore；but引导的也是从句，表示的是一种转折关系；当转折关系更为强烈时，则用however。
　　示例1：I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter.
　　示例2：He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.
　　2.not only…but…as well句型
　　这个句型与not only…but also…含义相同，只是结构上的差异而已，所以，请特别注意它们的套用模式。
