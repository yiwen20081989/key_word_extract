　　作者：北京新东方学校培训项目专家组
　　( )表示可有可无的话，字不够就加上。[a/b/c]表示方括号内由/分开的几句话选一句。
　　(一) 对立观点式
　　(1)给出两个对立的事物或者一个事物对立的两个方面，要求考生支持一方并进行说明。 具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: Some people like A; others like B. Which one do you prefer -- A or B? Give specific reasons and examples to illustrate your answer。
　　(2)给出两个对立事物或一个事物对立的两个方面，要求考生说明二者为什么不同或比较它们的优缺点，并给出理由。 具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: Some people believe that A while others consider B more appropriate. Give advantages and disadvantages of the two positions and explain which position you support。
　　对立观点式的三种模板：
　　1.人们往往看到B的明显优点而忽视了它的缺点，同时A的内在优势没有被重视。
　　第一段：To choose A or to choose B is something of a dilemma to the public ause they sometimes are confused by the seemingly good qualities of B while neglect the genuinely good aspects of A。
　　第二段：[For B, people are often driven to believe that / It is quite easy for common people to CHOOSE B because of the obvious reason that] ____________. (As a proverb says, "Everything has two sides"。) Although B does have its seemingly profound advantages, in the meantime [there lie [harmful characteristics/ intrinsic drawbacks] in it such as ____________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________] . Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________. However, it is often overlooked [by the public/most people]. (Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that B is always better than A。)
　　第三段： Unfortunately, the innate quality of A is often underestimated。
　　或：What is more, if you notice the invisible benefits of CHOOSING A, you can understand A more deeply. Here I would explain a few of the most important reasons for choosing A. 第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。(列举原因的句式见最后的"通用句型")
　　第四段：Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that CHOOSING AAA is a rather wise decision。
　　2.选A还是选B的确是一个热门话题，我们来研究一下，A比B至少有三大优势：1，2，3。
　　第一段：There is no denying the fact that ____________(whether it is better to choose A or B) is a popular topic which is much talked about [not only by ____________, but also by ____________/by people across the world/ in a modern society]。
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(whether it is better to choose A or B) is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time (because it affects everybody in his or her daily lives)。
　　或：In a modern society, people are always faced with the dilemma of whether to choose A or B. This problem is a much-debated one in that it affects everybody in his or her daily lives。
　　或：(如果是针对某一事件的题目，不是什么popular topic)If ____________(it is announced that a new movie theater may be built ____________)， I will not be surprised to see ____________ (whether it is better to choose A or B) become a popular topic which is much talked about not only by ____________, but also by ____________. Although it seems that [sometimes we can not tell which one outweigh the other between A and B / they normally coexist peacefully], they deserve some close examination. [If three criteria were taken into account in comparing these two, I would prefer A. / As far as I am concerned, I vote for the latter]. There are no less than three advantages in A as rendered below:
　　第二段 第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。
　　第三段 In conclusion, (it must be explained that these three reasons sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive than any one of them。) Only these three reasons are enough to make a person draw the conclusion that ____________ , not to mention there are more。
　　3.选A还是选B的确是一个热门话题，我们来研究一下，二者各有优势，不过我来选的话，A的优点还是比B多。
　　第一段前两句同2，第三句
　　While both the two [methods/choices] may have their advantages and disadvantages, they can be applied under different circumstances. Later on, I will explain my opinion about it。
　　第二段：[A has the obvious advantage that / One very strong argument for A is that] ____________. But there lies intrinsic harmful characteristic in this method. Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________ Furthermore, ____________. Therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that A is always better than B。
　　第三段：On the other hand, choosing B also has advantages to some extent, For example, ____________. However, once again, it is important to see that under certain circumstances B will____________(disadvantage)
　　或：Yet there are some people who cast serious doubts on B
　　或：Although B does have its seemingly profound [advantages/ reason],in the meantime[there lie intrinsic [harmful characteristics/drawbacks] in it such as ________________________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________]。
　　第四段：(针对我个人的情况又可以说出一套理由)But if all these factors are contemplated, [as far as I am concerned / according to my knowledge], the advantages of A carry more weight than those of B because A fits [me/us students] better in two ways: In the first place, ____________, In the second place/secondly,____________Therefore from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that choosing A is a rather wise decision。
　　或：(我个人的情况说不出什么新的理由，只好说我觉得A优点就是比B多)
　　It seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because all of them have their advantages and disadvantages to the extent that it is hard to distinguish. Yet that does not mean that they are all the same to me. Which one I prefer depends on my own experience, life style and [emotional concerns / educational background/____________]. [As far as I am concerned / According to my personality and fondness/ To be frank], I would like to choose A, because there are too many benefits that outnumber its disadvantages not to choose it. B, on the other hand, has advantages no more than its disadvantages。
　　(二)单一观点式
　　两种形式：
　　(1)给出一个论点，此论点不包括两种事物的比较，要求考生支持或反对并给出理由。
　　具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: Do you ae or disagree with the following statement? AAA. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer。
　　(2)给出一个论点，主要是对两个事物进行比较的陈述，要求考生支持或反对并给出理由。
　　具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: A is superior to B. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons to support your point of view。
　　注：在模板中用A、B表示相比较的两个事物，这种形式与对立观点式有着很大的相似之处，考生可以进行适当的借鉴。
　　(2)可以使用对立观点式的模板。(1)的两种模板如下：
　　1.disagree这个问题的确是个热门话题，支持的人的理由是____________，但是它的错误在于____________。
　　第一段：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a hot topic which is much talked about [not only by ____________, but also by ____________ /by people across the world/ in a modern society]。
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time (ause it affects everybody in his or her daily lives)。
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a basic (moral/philosophical) problem that can not be circumvented by anybody,( because the opinion on this problem will determine one’s attitude toward the world and the life)。
　　或：(如果是针对某一事件的题目，不是什么popular topic)If ____________(it is announced
　　that a new movie theater may be built ____________)， I will not be surprised to see ____________ (whether the plan should be supported or opposed) become a popular topic which is much talked about not only by ____________, but also by ____________. Before rendering my opinion, I think it is important to take a glance at the arguments on both sides。
　　第二段：People who support AAA usually give (some, even all of) the following reasons. 第一点 原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。
　　第三段：At the first glance, the opinion saying yes to the above question perhaps sounds reasonable and appealing. Nevertheless, [many people do not think this view can hold water / we can find that it presents us with numerous negative effects along with its benefits.]
　　或：Although ____________(the opinion in question) does have its seemingly profound [advantages/reasons], in the meantime [there lie intrinsic [harmful characteristics /drawbacks/faults] in [it/this method] such as ____________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________]。
　　Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________. Unfortunately, it is often overlooked by [the public/most people]. (Therefore we have no complete evidence to conclude that the statement is right。) What is more, ____________
　　第四段：In a word, despite the fact that the argument I disagree does hold a little bit of water, I think that____________
