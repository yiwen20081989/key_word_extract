　　As I understand this CD is one of your favorites, I will try my best to send it back to you as soon as possible. So, could you please tell me where I should send it to? Or shall I send it directly to the place where I stayed? According to the regulations of China’s Postal Services, it will take almost a week to reach Canada.
