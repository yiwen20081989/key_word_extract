　　Along with the step of globalization, moststudents’ attention has shifted from Chinese to foreign cultures. Such a shiftbrought on great worries among people because it is not good for thedevelopment of Chinese culture。
　　There may be several reasons account forwhy this phenomenon could happen. First and foremost, the globalization greatlystimulated the spread of foreign cultures, which in turn stirred great interestamong Chinese students; second, college students are, to some extent, forced tostudy certain foreign languages so as to pass exams or find good jobs so thatthey could not spare any time to study Chinese; last but not least, schoolshave no strict demand on students’ Chinese standard. No doubt, neglecting thestudy of Chinese will ultimately hold back the development of Chinese culture,and Chinese people may lose their cultural identity in such a competitive world。
　　In order change this situation and save ouridentity, due attention should be given to the study of Chinese. To begin with,government should put great efforts on the development of Chinese culture tomake more people proud of it; besides, colleges and universities should makeexams more balanced, not simply emphasizing the importance of foreignlanguages; finally, schools should also attach great importance to the study ofChinese, making it a compulsory curriculum. Through these efforts, I think, chancesof changing this phenomenon are prosperous。
