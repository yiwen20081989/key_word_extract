牛年第一场考试：二月雅思写作必看
　　大作文不要害怕，一月份基本上混搭的趋势有所收敛，有几套题非常“单纯”，这点在二月份还将延续，看来英国佬总是和我们玩变和制变。本月明确的让你多看1号和3号的题目，应为科技的话题刚刚考过，几乎不可能再出现，所以锁定这两个还是可以的，2号球近期的频率也不高，略加准备即可。
　　1) In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find jobs after graduation. What problems do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and the society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.
　　2) Some people consider that history is of little or no use to us. Others believe that studying history helps us to know the present. Discuss these views and give your own opinion.
　　3) Some people prefer to provide help or support directly to the local community. Others prefer to give money to national or international charitableorganizations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
　　4) Some people think museums should be enjoyableplaces to attract and entertain young people. Others think the purpose of museums is to educate, not to entertain. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.
