环球时代：英语专业八级改错练习
Sporting activities are essentially modified forms of hunting behavior. Viewing biologically, the modern footballer is revealed as a member of a disguised hunting pack. His killing weapon has turned into a harmless football and his prey into a goal-mouth. If his aim is inaccurate andhe scores a goal, enjoy the hunter's triumph of killing his prey.To understand how this transformation has taken place we must briefly look up at our ancient ancestors. They spent over a million year evolving as co-operative hunters. Their very survival depended on success in the hunting-field. Under this pressure their whole way of life, even if their bodies, became radically changed. They became chasers,runners, jumpers, aimers, throwers and prey killers. They co-operate as skillful male-group attackers. Then, about ten thousand years ago, when this immensely long formative period of hunting for food, they became farmers. Their improved intelligence, so vital to their old hunting life, were put to a new use—that of penning ( 把…关在圈中 ) , controlling and domesticating their prey.The food was there on the farms, awaiting their needs. The risks and uncertainties of farming were no longer essential for survival.
