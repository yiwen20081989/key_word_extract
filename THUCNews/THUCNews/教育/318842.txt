雅思范文：经济与文化交流
　　There is more international business and cultural communication between countries. To what extent do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?
　　International business and cultural communication between countries are increasingly active in this age, which promotes global economic development and understanding among nations. On the other hand, they do bring harms to local environment and damage the local cultural identities to some extent. However, I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages。
　　International business helps countries to optimize both material resources and labor. It saves cost of production, provides employment opportunities for people in certain countries and enables people to buy products at a very low price. For example, some computer companies choose to set up their factories in developing countries where they can find relatively cheap labor to assemble computers. This not only relieves the unemployment pressure in some areas but also make it possible to market inexpensive softwares. Moreover, international business enables countries to share resources. For example, it is expensive to produce rice but wheat in one country, but cheap in the other. Then these countries can concentrate on the production of the cheap ones and trade them with the other。
　　Cultural communication can promote understanding and share the essence of culture between countries. More cultural exchange can expose a more comprehensive image of a nation to the other. People tend to form stereotypes for people from certain countries. For example, most Americans think Chinese people are poor, conservative and old-fashioned. Through more cultural activities such as TV programs, movies, live performances, educational exchange etc, people understand more about how modern Chinese cities are, how open-minded and creative Chinese people has become. Besides, since every nation has its distinctive culture and tradition. Cultural communication makes it possible for different nations to share the essence of their culture. For instance, the embroidery and china ware in China are introduced into many areas in the world through international trade and exhibitions. More and more people can enjoy the pretty handicrafts. Sharing is often beneficial to the majority。
　　We have to admit that in some cases, international trade harms the local environment and people in some countries have lost their cultural identiy because of cultural invasion. owever, these harmful effects can be reduced given more awareness of them. To sum up, I think international trade and cultural communication will bring more benefits than harms。
