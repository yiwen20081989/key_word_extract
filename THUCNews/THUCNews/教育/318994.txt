　　Living in College Dormitories
　　Many students are obliged to share accommodation with others in college. Living in dormitories
　　may seem awkward at first, but it may prove to be a very rewarding experience. In this essay, both
　　benefits and disadvantages will be discussed。
　　If you have never shared with someone, you may have some difficulties adjusting. You may find
　　others very different in character and habits and not suit you as companions. For some people, the lack
　　of privacy is the biggest challenge, while others may find their roommates over-sensitive or distant。
　　Despite the problems, there are many positive aspects to sharing. Since new students are often
　　far away from their families and friends, they may experience loneliness and homesickness, and face
　　new challenges in their studies. Sharing offers companionship to students who might otherwise have
　　to face these problems alone. Furthermore, since college is not just about academic learning, sharing
　　is an opportunity to develop communication skills and abilities to deal with different people. Besides,
　　roommates can learn from each other about new interests and explore new activities。
　　In conclusion, I think that there are more benefits than disadvantages in living in college dormitories, but it depends on dealing with concerns honestly and sensitively in order to make student life
　　as happy as possible。
