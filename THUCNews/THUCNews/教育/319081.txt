　　TV Game Shows
　　One of the most fascinating things about television is the size of the audience. A novel can be on the "best seller" lists with a sale of fewer than 100,000 copies, but a popular TV show might have 70 million TV viewers. TV can make anything or anyone well-known overnight。
　　This is the principle behind "quiz" or "game" shows, which put ordinary people on TV to play a game for prizes and money. A quiz show can make anyone a star, and it can give away thousands of dollars in the U.S. and almost everyone watched them. Charles Van Doren, an English instructor, became rich and famous after winning money on several shows. He even had a career as a television personality. But one of the losers proved that Charles Van Doren was cheating. It turned out that the show's producers who were pulling the strings, gave the answers to the most popular contestants beforehand. Why? Because if the audience didn't like the person who won the game, they turned the show off. The result of this cheating was a huge scandal. Based on his story, a movie under the title "Quiz Show" is on 40 years later。
　　Charles Van Doren is no longer involved with TV. But game shows are still here, though they aren't taken as seriously. In fact, some of them try to be as ridiculous as possible. There are shows that send strangers on vacation trips together, or that try to cause newly-married couples to fight on TV, or that punish losers by humiliation them. The entertainment now is to see what people will do just to be on TV. People still win money, but the real prize is to be in front of an audience of millions。

　　三、阅读理解
　　阅读下面的短文，短文后有5道题，每题后面有4个选项。请仔细阅读短文并根据短文回答其后面的问题，从4个选项中选择1个最佳答案。
　　Football
　　Football is， I suppose， the most popular game in England： one has only to go to one of the important matches to see this. Rich and poor， young and old， one can see them all there， shouting and cheering for one side or the other。
　　One of the most surprising things about football in England to a stranger is the great knowledge of the game which even the smallest boy seems to have. He can tell you the names of the players in most of the important teams. He has photographs of them and knows the results of a large number of matches. He will tell you， with a great air of authority， who he expects will win such and such a match， and his opinion is usually as valuable as that of men three or four times his age。
　　Most schools in England take football seriously - much more seriously than nearly all European schools， where lessons are all-important (至关重要的)， and games left for private arrangements. In England， it is believed that education is not only a matter of filling a boy's mind with facts in a classroom； education also means character training； and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games， especially team games， where the boy has to learn to work with others for his team， instead of working selfishly (自私地) for himself alone. The school therefore arranges games and matches for its pupils Football is a good team game， it is good exercise for the body， it needs skill and a quick brain， it is popular and it is cheap： as a result， it is the school's favorite game in the winter。

　　2.A stranger in England will be surprised to find that in that country
　　A people have little knowledge of football。
　　B girls are more interested in football than boys。
　　C even small boys know a lot about football。
　　D children are not interested in football at all。
　　3.There is a great difference between schools in England and those in Europe in that
　　A European schools take football seriously。
　　B European schools often arrange football matches for their pupils。
　　C schools in England care little about lessons。
　　D schools in England believe character training to be part of education。

　　A It makes people selfish。
　　B It encourages cooperation。
