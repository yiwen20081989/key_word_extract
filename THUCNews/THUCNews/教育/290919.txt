分享：名师指导四级写作提高 如何改写范文
　　新四级(CET-4)考试作文部分题序位置位置发生改变，从以前考试的最后一部分提到了第一部分。它影响着考生的临场心理，其重要性自然不言而喻。考生如何利用考场下的300分钟、3000分钟甚至30000分钟，合理充分地准备四级写作，从而能够轻松自如地应对考场上的30分钟呢？

　　Should the University Campus Be Open to Tourists?
　　Nowadays, many famous university campuses have become one of the popular tourist attractions. It has been shown on TV and on the radio that every year thousands and thousands of middle school students visit Tsing Hua University and Peking University and other famous universities in China. In the place far away from the capital city, the local students also visit the universities famous in their own province。
　　So far as the present situation is concerned, is it a good or bad thing to open the university campus for tourists? Different people have different opinions. On one hand, some people argued that it is a good thing for the students to visit the famous university campus in that it can enable the middle students to get more information about the university and they can have enough time and opportunity to prepare themselves with the chance to get into the university. On the other hand, some people hold a negative view about this phenomenon. In their opinion, the public tourism will have negative effect on the universities because it will not only do harm to the environment but also to the intellectual atmosphere。
　　In my opinion, the tourism to the universities is not a good thing. The campus is mainly a place for study. With the increasing tourism on the campus, it will ruin the spiritual atmosphere in this learning field。
