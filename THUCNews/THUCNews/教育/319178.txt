轻松打造PETS作文论说文模板之单一观点式
　　(二)单一观点式
　　两种形式：
　　(1)给出一个论点，此论点不包括两种事物的比较，要求考生支持或反对并给出理由。
　　具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: Do you ae or disagree with the following statement? AAA. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer。
　　(2)给出一个论点，主要是对两个事物进行比较的陈述，要求考生支持或反对并给出理由。
　　具体表述如下：
　　TOPIC: A is superior to B. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons to support your point of view。
　　注：在模板中用A、B表示相比较的两个事物，这种形式与对立观点式有着很大的相似之处，考生可以进行适当的借鉴。
　　(2)可以使用对立观点式的模板。(1)的两种模板如下：
　　1.disagree这个问题的确是个热门话题，支持的人的理由是____________，但是它的错误在于____________。
　　第一段：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a hot topic which is much talked about [not only by ____________, but also by ____________ /by people across the world/ in a modern society]。
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time (ause it affects everybody in his or her daily lives)。
　　或：There is no denying the fact that ____________(if one should ____________ /if ____________ is right) is a basic (moral/philosophical) problem that can not be circumvented by anybody,( because the opinion on this problem will determine one’s attitude toward the world and the life)。
　　或：(如果是针对某一事件的题目，不是什么popular topic)If ____________(it is announced
　　that a new movie theater may be built ____________)， I will not be surprised to see ____________ (whether the plan should be supported or opposed) become a popular topic which is much talked about not only by ____________, but also by ____________. Before rendering my opinion, I think it is important to take a glance at the arguments on both sides。
　　第二段：People who support AAA usually give (some, even all of) the following reasons. 第一点 原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。
　　第三段：At the first glance, the opinion saying yes to the above question perhaps sounds reasonable and appealing. Nevertheless, [many people do not think this view can hold water / we can find that it presents us with numerous negative effects along with its benefits.]
　　或：Although ____________(the opinion in question) does have its seemingly profound [advantages/reasons], in the meantime [there lie intrinsic [harmful characteristics /drawbacks/faults] in [it/this method] such as ____________ / it can be achieved only conditionally because____________]。
　　Some [people/experts] [maintain/warn] that____________. Unfortunately, it is often overlooked by [the public/most people]. (Therefore we have no complete evidence to conclude that the statement is right。) What is more, ____________
　　第四段：In a word, despite the fact that the argument I disagree does hold a little bit of water, I think that____________
　　2.Agree或disagree都可以用。这个问题的确是个热门话题，乍一看不好说，不能仓促下结论，但是我同意/不同意它，至少有3条理由：1，2，3。(下面是按agree写的，容易改为disagree的模板)
　　第一段
　　第一句同1 ，第二句：
　　At first glance it seems very difficult for us to draw a [definite/quick] conclusion that ____________ is right or wrong, [because it has both advantages and disadvantages / since everything has two sides]. However, after serious considerations we can see that under most circumstances ____________(this approach) [will do more good than harm / is a rather wise viewpoint]。
　　或：As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion. However, it is unfair to draw a quick conclusion without serious considerations. There are no less than [three advantages in A/three reasons to agree with the opinion] as rendered below:
　　第二段 第一点原因。第二点原因。第三点原因。
　　第三段 In conclusion, (it must be explained that these three reasons sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive than any one of them。) Only these three reasons can make [a person/me] draw the conclusion that _____________ , not to mention there are more。
