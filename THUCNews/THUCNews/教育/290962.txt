　　Passage Three
　　Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage。
　　Brazil has become one of the developing world’s great successes at reducing population growth-but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard。
　　Brazil’s population growth rate has dropped from 2.99% a year between 1951 and 1960 to 1.93% a year between 1981 and 1990, and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. Martine says this figure may have fallen still further since 1990, an achievement that makes it the envy of many other Third World countries。
　　Martine puts it down to, among other things, soap operas (通俗电视连续剧) and installment (分期付款) plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect, role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world’s biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil’s most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most soaps are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities。
　　“Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction, they describe middle and upper class values-not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,” says Martine. “They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package。”
　　Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. “This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and consumption was incompatible (不相容的) with unlimited reproduction,” says Martine。
　　31. According to the passage, Brazil has cut back its population growth ________。
　　A) by educating its citizens
　　B) by careful family planning
　　C) by developing TV programmes
　　D) by chance
　　32. According to the passage, many Third World countries ________。
　　A) haven’t attached much importance to birth control
　　B) would soon join Brazil in controlling their birth rate
　　C) haven’t yet found an effective measure to control their population
　　D) neglected the role of TV plays in family planning
　　33. The phrase “puts it down to” (Line 1, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to “________”。
　　A) attributes it to
　　B) finds it a reason for
　　C) sums it up as
　　D) compares it to
　　34. Soap operas have helped in lowering Brazil’s birth rate because ________。
　　A) they keep people sitting long hours watching TV
　　B) they have gradually changed people’s way of life
　　C) people are drawn to their attractive package
　　D) they popularize birth control measures
　　35. What is Martine’s conclusion about Brazil’s population growth?
　　A) The increase in birth rate will promote consumption。
　　B) The desire for consumption helps to reduce birth rate。
　　C) Consumption patterns and reproduction patterns are contradictory。
　　D) A country’s production is limited by its population growth。
　　Passage Four
　　Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage。
　　There seems never to have been a civilization without toys, but when and how they developed is unknown. They probably came about just to give children something to do。
　　In the ancient world, as is today, most boys played with some kinds of toys and most girls with another. In societies where social roles are rigidly determined, boys pattern their play after the activities of their fathers and girls after the tasks of their mothers. This is true because boys and girls are being prepared, even in play, to step into the roles and responsibilities of the adult world。
　　What is remarkable about the history of toys is not so much how they changed over the centuries but how much they have remained are same. The changes have been mostly in terms of craftsmanship, mechanics, and technology. It is the universality of toys with regard to their development in all parts of the world and their persistence to the present that is amazing. In Egypt, the Americas, China, Japan and among the Arctic (北极的) peoples, generally the same kinds of toys appeared. Variations depended on local customs and ways of life because toys imitate their surroundings. Nearly every civilization had dolls, little weapons, toy soldiers, tiny animals and vehicles。
　　Because toys can be generally regarded as a kind of art form, they have not been subject to technological leaps that characterize inventions for adult use. The progress from the wheel to the oxcart to the automobile is a direct line of ascent (进步). The progress from a rattle (拨浪鼓) used by a baby in 3000 BC to one used by an infant today, however, is not characterized by inventiveness. Each rattle is the product of the artistic tastes of the times and
　　subject to the limitations of available materials。
　　36. The reason why the toys most boys play with are different from those that girls play with is that ________。
　　A) their social roles are rigidly determined
　　B) most boys would like to follow their fathers’ professions
　　C) boys like to play with their fathers while girls with their mothers
　　D) they like challenging activities
　　37. One aspect of “the universality of toys” lies in the fact that ________。
　　A) technological advances have greatly improved the durability of toys
　　B) the improvement of craftsmanship in making toys depends on the efforts of universities
　　C) the exploration of the universe had led to the creation of new kinds of toys
　　D) the basic characteristics of toys are the same the world over
　　38. Which of the following is the author’s view on the historical development of toys?
　　A) The craftsmanship in toy-making has remained essentially unchanged。
　　B) Toys have remained basically the same all through the centuries。
　　C) The toy industry has witnessed great leaps in technology in recent years。
　　D) Toys are playing an increasingly important role in shaping a child’s character。
　　39. Regarded as a kind of art form, toys ________。
　　A) follow a direct line of ascent
　　B) also appeal greatly to adults
　　C) are not characterized by technological progress
　　D) reflect the pace of social progress
　　40. The author uses the example of rattle to show that ________。
　　A) in toy-making there is a continuity in the sue of materials
　　B) even the simplest toys can reflect the progress of technology
　　C) even the simplest toys can reflect the progress of technology
