09年12月英语六级听力长对话真题文本
　　M: I see your new resume that you worked as a manager of store called Computer Country, could you tell me a little more about your responsibilities there?
　　W: Sure. I was responsible for overseeing about 30 employees. I did all of the orderings for the store and I kept track of the inventory。
　　M: What was the most difficult part of your job?
　　W: Probably handling angry customers. We didn’t have them very often, but when we did, I need to make sure they were well taken good care of. After all, the customer is always right。
　　M: That’s how we feel here, too. How long did you work there?
　　W: I was there for three and a half years. I left the company last month。
　　M: And why did you leave?
　　W: My husband has been transferred to Boston and I understand that your company has an opening there, too。
　　M: Yes, that’s right. We do. But the position won’t start until early next month. Would that be a problem for you?
　　W: No, not at all. My husband’s new job doesn’t begin for a few weeks, so we thought we would spend some time driving to Boston and stop to see my parents。
　　M: That sounds nice. So, tell me, why are you interested in this particular position?
　　W: I know that your company has a great reputation and wonderful product. I’ve thought many times that I would like to be a part of it. When I heard about the opening in Boston, I jumped to the opportunity。
　　M: Well, I’m glad you did。

　　Long Conversation 2
　　W: Today, in this studio, we have Alberto Cuties, the well-known Brazilian advocator of the anti-global movement. He’s here to talk about the recent report stating that by 2050, Brazil will be one of the world’s wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say about this report?
　　M: You know this isn’t the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over 100 years ago, but it didn’t happen。
　　W: Yes, but you must admit the world’s a very different place now。
　　M: Of course. In fact, I believe that there may be some truths in the predictions this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment。
　　W: Such as?
　　M: There’s an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In San Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slum areas without proper water or electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives。
　　W: What needs to be done?
　　M: Education, for example. For Brazil, to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries, like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries。
　　W: So you’re hopeful for the future?
　　W: As I said earlier, I’m hopeful. This isn’t an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren’t wasted as they were in the past。
