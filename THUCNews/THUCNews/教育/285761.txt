教育展参展高校简介：荷兰阿姆斯特丹自由大学
　　2009年中国国际教育展将于10月17日在北京拉开帷幕，随后巡回武汉、上海、成都和广州5个城市，以下为荷兰此次参展院校荷兰阿姆斯特丹自由大学简介：
　　Statesman and theologian Abraham Kuyper founded his Vrije Universiteit in 1880 as a private initiative: the fi rst Dutch　university not controlled by the church or state. Hence the name,　the ‘Free University’. For many years it was maintained solely by　private donations; supporters would collect coins in special VU tins. Yet the institution grew steadily ? from just five students and　five professors in 1880 to more than 19,000 students and 4,000 staff today. But all still on one campus, to make cooperation across　discipline boundaries easier. We also have our own teaching　hospital, the VU University Medical Center (VUmc)， situated very　close to our campus and with which we work together intensively.
