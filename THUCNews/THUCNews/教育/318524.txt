名师点评雅思口语近期话题：儿时的朋友
　　Describe a school friend you remember well.
　　You should say:
　　who this person was
　　what he/she looked like
　　how you became friends
　　and explain why you remember this person so well.
　　Sample Answer:
　　The school friend I remember well is Sara. She’s not only my school friend, but also my best friend. I’ve known her since we were in middle school.
　　She is of the same height with me, but thinner. With beautiful eyes and straight black hair, she’s really a pretty girl.
　　We became friends because we were born on exactly the same day and we happened to hold the birthday party at the same KFC when we were 14. That day, we became friends.
　　We’ve been friends for 7 years. I remember her so well because she is someone who is the exact personal mirror image of myself. We understand each other like soul mates. We were all young and rebellious and she understood my madness. She knows me better than I know myself at times, at the most critical times. She is who I want to call first when I feel I'm in crisis. Now, though we are in different cities, we still keep in touch with each by phone and email.
　　Part 3
　　Are there any differences between childhood friends and friends in adulthood?
　　Actually yes. First, a childhood friendship has innocence and there are easier ties to make with someone when you are younger. There are also easier ways to find things in common with another person when you are younger. When you’re older it’s kind of like having the safety net removed. Then, you can do something as a kid in a friendship and it’s either cute or brushed off. As an adult it’s a little harder because if something is misconstrued then even the most rational person can get upset.
　　Which do you think is better, to have a large group of friends or just a few close friends?
　　Definitely a few good friends. Less worry and problems to deal with. I believe in quality over quantity when it comes to close friends. I feel more comfortable hanging out with my small band of pals, and I know I can be myself and I trust them all implicitly.
　　How is the way people make friends today different to the way people made friends years ago?
　　Well, the way people make friends today is not much different from the way people used to. You meet someone and hang out with them and see if your personality clicks.
　　Do you think it’s important (or necessary) to keep in contact with childhood friends?
　　All I could think of is the song: ‘make new friends, but keep the old, one is silver but the other gold.’ Keeping old friends has shown to be a good stress reducer. Talking with an old friend and laughing at how things were is always great fun. When I talk with old friends, it feels so comfortable and great and it makes me feel warm all over. So I think it’s important to maintain childhood friends.
