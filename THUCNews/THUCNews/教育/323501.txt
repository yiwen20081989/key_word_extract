　　As we all know that 2010 World Expo will be held in Shanghai , this is the first time that China hosted the World Expo. The World Expo has a long history but it has never been held in Asia. So it is a great honor for our country. It is also a great honor for all the Asians. As a host city, Shanghai will have more chances to develop quickly. The theme of the Expo is "Better City, Better Life". We all really hope that Shanghai will become more exciting and attractive and that we can enjoy life to the fullest. Organizers expected to attract 70 million visitors from all over the world to attend, at the same time it is also the largest in the history of World Expo. It is a good chance for China to show its achievements in many fields。
