　　The university’s branch campuses in suburban areas
　　In recent years more and more universities have built up their branch campuses in suburban areas. Now it is very difficult to find a university without a branch campus. Maybe no one can tell clearly when the first branch campus came out。
　　But the reasons behind this phenomenon are obvious. Among these reasons, the enrollment expansion of universities plays a very vital role. As more and more freshmen are remitted to universities, the original facilities, including classrooms, apartments, dining houses, laboratories and the like, are not enough any more. What’s more, the land in the suburb is relatively low in price, which is affordable for most universities. Besides, the quiet environment in suburban areas is more suitable for students to study。
　　As a college student, I think, it is necessary and beneficial for many universities to build up a branch campus. However the building of branch campuses brings some problems. For one thing, the students in some branch campuses cannot enjoy good enough facilities and the teachers due to limited resources. For another it leads to less direct communications among teachers and students. Therefore the university should take a full account before it decides to build up a branch campus。
