　　how shuould parents help children to be independent?
　　There is no denying the fact that independence plays an increasingly important part in our daily life and we can’t help asking such a question: how should parents help children to be independent?
　　To begin with, it is imperative that parents provide opportunities to children and allow them to participate in the social games which contribute to the independence of the children. What’s more, under the excessive care and protection of parents, these children are lack of the ability to overcome the difficulties that abound in their real life. Therefore, it’s a must for parents to cultivate the independence which helps their children easily conquer and frustration and depression。
　　To conclude, it's essential for us to dispose of the problem of children’s independence timely and effectively. Parents should help children develop strong independence and the abilities needed in the future. Only in this way can they be ready to confront any challenges in the society of fierce competition。
