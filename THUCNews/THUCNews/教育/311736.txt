　　参考范文：
　　Dear Editor,
　　I'm writing for the purpose of expressing my views on further prohibiting the use of plastic bags. China has officially enacted the law of plastic bag restriction, but it is observed in vain in several places, thus resulting in the continuing of white pollution. 
　　Having the largest population in the world, China is exposed to the most serious plastic pollution. With the quickening pace of life, various disposable products are closely related to our regular life, including unrecyclable lunch boxes and plastic shopping bags. As it is difficult for them to decompose, people find themselves surrounded by an expanding ocean of white rubbish.
　　As a result, it is advisable to solve the problems by three means. 
　　Above all, importance should be attached to reinforcing the implementation of the law. In addition, people in those places should gradually enhance their environmental awareness. There is no denying that your magazine should play an important role in preaching the necessity of limiting the plastic bags. 
　　Thank you for your patience and concern in reading this letter.
