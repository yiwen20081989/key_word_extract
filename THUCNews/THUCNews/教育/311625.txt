　　Applying for the Position of Assistant for Marketing Project Manager
　　Directions:
　　You are a senior of English for Business. A German company in China is recruiting an assistant to marketing project manager, which requires a good command of English and knowledge in German especially. Write a letter of about 100 words applying for the position, introducing yourself and asking for an interview. You needn’t write the address. Do not sign your own name at the end of the letter, using “Wang Lin” instead.
　　Dear Sirs,
　　I am graduating from the Shanghai Institute of Foreign Trade this summer. As a student of English for Business, I hope to work for a foreign company after graduation.
　　In the past three academic years, I have proved myself to be a straight student, awarded a succession of scholarships. My English is particularly good and German happens to be my second foreign language, which will live up to the requirements set by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise like yours.
　　I apply for the position of assistant to your marketing project manager. You will find me a good team player, self-motivated and eager to learn. I believe I can be of value to your company.
　　Enclosed please find my resume.
　　I should be very happy if you would arrange an interview with me.
