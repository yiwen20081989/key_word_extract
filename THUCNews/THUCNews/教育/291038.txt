　　听力原文：
　　There are many commonly held beliefs about eye glasses and eye sight. For instance, someone believes that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes, but there is no evidence to show that the eye structure is changed by wearing eye glasses at young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Study shows that for adult, there is no danger, but children can develop lost vision if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes. We have all heard about how eye sights get bad. Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eye sight, but that’s untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired on strained. Eye strain also results from reading a lot. Reading in bed, and watching too much TV. However, although eye strain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not permanently damage eyesight. Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced or transferred from one person to another. There are close to 1 million nerve fibers (神经纤维)that connect the eye ball to brain. As if yet, it is impossible to attach them all in a new person. Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if we keep clearing up the myths, and learn more about the eyes, a full transplant can be may be possible。
