考研英语阅读辅导：判定作者态度的三大方法
　　在考研英语阅读理解题型中，作者态度题每年都会涉及，题量不会很大，基本每次一题。能否正确把握作者态度对于文章的整体理解是至关重要的。
　　1.标志：attitude
　　2.作者的态度只分为三种：支持或赞同；中立或客观；怀疑、批评或反对
　　3. 判定作者态度的方法
　　A)寻找带有作者强烈感情色彩的名词、动词、形容词或者副词来判定作者态度。
　　如2009年大纲样题(1996年真题)“The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible (不负责任的，明显是一个贬义词，作者就是批判股东的)wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business。”“Fortunately, (幸运的，明显后面连接的是作者支持的，即行业公会起了一个好的作用)however, the increasing power and organisation of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them。”
　　61. According of the passage, all of the following are true except that ________。
　　[A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers
　　[B] the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers
　　[C] the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly
　　[D] the trade unions seemed to play a positive role (行业公会扮演了一个积极的角色)
　　62. The author is most critical of ________。
　　[A] family firm owners
　　[B] landowners
　　[C] managers
　　[D] shareholders (批判股东) 　　
　　B)段首句中含有“but, yet, however, in fact”类表示强转折关系的词时，这句话通常表征作者观点。　　
　　如2004年第四篇：
　　"Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual," says education writer Diane Ravitch. "Schools could be a counterbalance." Razitch’s latest bock, Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits。
　　But they could and should be. (但学校可能也应该成为一种反学识的抗衡力，即作者是支持学识的)Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, "We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil society."
　　60、What does the author think of intellect?
　　[A] It is second to intelligence。
　　[B] It evolves from common sense。
　　[C] It is to be pursued. (支持学识观点，即学识值得我们追求)
　　[D] It underlies power. 　　
　　C) 根据作者所举的例证来判定。正面的例子就是支持，反面的例子就是反对，一正一反就是中立客观。
　　如2009年大纲样题(1997年真题)“Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death — probably by a deadly injection or pill — to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two doctors. After a "cooling off" period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. "I'm not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I'd go, because I've watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks," he says。”(安乐死的通过提高了他的生活质量，明显是一个正面的例子，就表达了作者的观点——支持安乐死)
　　54. The author's attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of ________。
　　[A] opposition
　　[B] suspicion
　　[C] approval (支持)
　　[D] indifference
　　4.作者态度题中经常出的表征态度的形容词
　　A)支持或赞成：positive, approving, supportive, optimistic, sympathetic, complimentary, affectionate, confident, appreciative, similar, identical
　　B)中立或客观：neutral, objective, impartial, unbiased, detached
　　C)怀疑、批评或反对：negative, disapproving, critical, pessimistic, doubtful, questioning, suspicious, skeptical, scornful, contemptible, opposite, cynical
　　D)错误选项，永远不选：subjective, indifferent, puzzling, compromising, biased
