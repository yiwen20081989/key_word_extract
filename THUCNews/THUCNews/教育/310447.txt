　　文字说明：“你一条腿，我一条腿；你我一起，走南闯北。”
　　As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, supporting each other with their powerful hands, two handicapped adolescents are continuing their new journey on the ground. Crutches left behind, they have successfully cracked the hard nut of lameness which might have confused the majority of the disabled. The caption indicates, “You have merely one leg and so do I. Helping each other, we can travel extensively.”
　　Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist is trying to attract our attention to the issue of cooperation. According to a survey conducted among a group of people who were in the same college class 10 years ago, those who are ready to give their cooperation to others all become rich or managers of all field, while not a single young man having difficulty in getting along with their classmates becomes an executive or boss. Why those who are excellent in team work tend to be managers or own their own enterprise in their later life? The answer seems self-evident. On the one hand, if you are competent in profession, but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even your boss, you can hardly survive the corporation. On the other hand, your chances of success are much higher with wide circle of friends who are willing to cooperate with you to provide information and resources.
