IMF执行董事会就卡恩被诉召开特别会议
　　新浪财经讯 美国东部时间5月16日下午(北京时间5月17日凌晨)消息，新浪财经获悉，国际货币基金组织(IMF)发表声明称，执行董事会周一下午召开特别会议，听取高级官员就总裁卡恩遭受起诉的口头报告。IMF及执行董事会密切关注事态发展。
　　IMF对外关系主任Caroline Atkinson表示，作口头报告的高级官员包括执行总裁约翰-列普斯基(John Lipsky)和法律顾问肖恩-哈根(Sean Hagan)。同时声明行文间强调，卡恩是出于私人原因前往纽约。
　　此外，对于媒体反复报道卡恩入住的索菲特酒店每晚收费3000美元，IMF特发声明称，IMF对雇员公务出差的酒店入住标准有清晰规定，在纽约酒店入住上限为每晚386美元(含税和服务收费)，卡恩因为私人原因前往纽约，是自掏腰包支付酒店房钱。
　　新浪财经证实，IMF发言人William Murray透露，卡恩所住索菲特酒店房钱为每晚525美元，有别于此前媒体报道的3000美元。截至发稿时，索菲尔酒店及其母集团未对此作出回应。(颜茜 发自美国纽约)
　　以下是IMF两条声明稿英文原文：
　　声明一：Ms. Caroline Atkinson, Director of the External Relations Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)， issued the following statement today:
　　“The Executive Board convened this afternoon in informal session to receive a verbal report from senior Fund officials, including Mr. John Lipsky, Acting Managing Director, and Mr. Sean Hagan, the Fund’s General Counsel, on developments related to Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn。
　　“The Board was briefed regarding criminal charges that have been brought against the Managing Director during a private visit to New York City。”
　　The IMF and its Executive Board will continue to monitor developments。”
　　声明二：Hotels:
　　In response to questions, we offer the following:
　　IMF staff have clear rules for where they may stay and how much they may pay on official travel, with an established system of preferred hotels and set rates, negotiated centrally. The Sofitel is not on the list of New York hotels, which are generally standard business hotels. At present, the maximum hotel rate in New York for staff on official business is $386 a night, including tax and service charges。
　　The Managing Director was staying in New York on private business. As such, he pays out of his own pocket for hotels。
